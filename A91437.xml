            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> in this our humble tender as you did to them.</p>
            <p>Surely the Parliament would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (with ſuch a publike lifting up of hands to the moſt high) have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Covenant to reform (as the ultimate end of it) the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in Doctrine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: Yea they would never have commanded us inferiours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of their diſpleaſure (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have been looked on as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious that refuſed) to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaid Covenant for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea they would never (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) have convocated an Aſſembly of Engliſh, and Scotiſh Divines, to ſearch out the truth which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to godlineſs, but that it was there real intention, that ſuch a worſhip of God (which is made the chief motive to the Covenant)
<pb facs="tcp:115397:5"/>might be found out and eſtabliſhed in three Nations, whereby Gods people might become one, and the name of God in truth one among them.</p>
            <p>Right worthy Heroes, when I conſidered of theſe particulars, I reſolved (againſt all impediments) humbly to preſent this unto you, and to the publick view; becauſe I am obliged unto it, by the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to yeild my indeavors, in my place and calling, to the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which I cannot, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, perform in any way, like the publiſhing this <hi>examen,</hi> to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many, yea if it be the will of God, the deceived Authors of that Confeſſion, who have ſo failed in a Confeſsion of Faith, ſet out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the judgements and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of three Nations in a good life,
<pb facs="tcp:115397:5"/>(the ſum of all) toward God and man.</p>
            <p>Give me leave therefore (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) to uſe in ſome meaſure of ſincerity the words of <hi>Job, cap.</hi> 36.2.3. Suffer me a little, and I will ſhew you what I have to ſay on Gods behalf, I will fetch my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from afar, and will aſcribe righteouſneſs to my Maker.</p>
            <p>My prayer is likewiſe that the Authors of the ſecond Directory may recollect themſelves to do the like; that their ſecond thoughts may be better then their firſt, and I wiſh they may be ſo far from envy and diſpleaſure, at what is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to publicke view, as they may ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 141.15. It ſhall be an excellent oyle, like that which Chriſt counſelled the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Revela.</hi> 3.18.
<pb facs="tcp:115397:6"/>to buy, and annoint their eyes that they may ſee the truth, which will appear to all that try all things by the touchſtone of truth, the word of God; which the Aſſembly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. of their confeſsion, to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infallible rule of inter preta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which rule we all that have our head and heart, concurring to prepare this or the like examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the Preſs, referr our ſelves; who would have ſubſcribed our names, but that the fear of envy, and ſome other evil conſequences, preſs a concealment of ſome; but I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veured to offer this (moſt honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Patriots) to your ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, &amp; to ſubſcribe my name, becauſe I doubted that a <hi>Smect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:115397:6"/>which in another caſe, though I was not <hi>ſponte nocens,</hi> I ſuffered deeply for) which is, that ſome (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) muſt ſubſcribe their name to own (if they will avoid offence) what is printed; therfore I have put my hopes in my hand, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured the ſubſcribing my name, that this may come forth according to order, and I fulfill the Proverb, The worſt muſt hold the candle, that by the light thereof all that do not out of prejudice ſhut their eyes, may ſee truth from error, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in the foreſaid confeſſion; the diſcovery of which I am induced to hold forth, becauſe for many yeers I have, to ſome detriment, bin under the cenſure of many ſuppoſed great errors againſt many aſſertions laid down in the ſaid Confeſsion: therefore to vindicate my ſelf; I

That thoſe former ways of Gods revealing his will unto his people are now ceaſed; where, if you by thoſe former wayes, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch wayes and meanes whereby God either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily inſtructed the people, as he taught the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Patriarches, by the Patriarches themſelves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. and the people of the old world by the preaching of <hi>Noah;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. or extraordinarily, by Angels, Dreams, Viſions, Inſpirations, and the like, revealed his will to the Prophets and Apoſtles of old, you are very much miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>For as Gods arm is not now ſhortened, ſo neither is his care, good will, and love towards the ſons of men changed.

                  <p>Iſai. 59.21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord; my ſpirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>

                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 6 9, 10, 11. Among other things to come, <hi>John</hi> ſaw (when Chriſt had opened the fift ſeal) under the Altar the ſoules of them lying which were ſlain for the word of God, and for the Teſtimony which they held, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and heard that more of them ſhould be ſlain. Now this their Teſtimony, is not onely called the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt: Rev.</hi> 12.17. but alſo the Spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie it ſelf. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9 10.</p>
                  <p>Even when Babylon is not onely come to her height, but her downfal alſo, there are Apoſtles and Prophets found in the Church, who are called to rejoyce at her overthrow. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Rejoyce over her thou Heaven and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her:</hi> ſee alſo verſ 24. <hi>For in her was found the blood of holy Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that are ſlain upon the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115397:22"/>To all which add that of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 7.27. <hi>For ſhee, that is, Wiſdom, being but one, can do all things; and remaining in her ſelf, ſhe maketh all things new; and in all ages entring into holy ſouls, ſhe makes them friends of God and Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of all which, and many Scriptures more, it is evident that the Lord wil have Prophets in all ages, and eſpecially when he is about to bring extraordinary Judgments upon the World in generall, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in ſpeciall; and that the laſt times ſhall abound moſt of all with the prophetical Spirit; ſo that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ways of Gods revealing himſelf, neither are ceaſed, nor ſhall determine in the Militant Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the third Section you Words are theſe; <q>The Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of Divine inſpiration; are no part of the Canon of the Scriptures; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwiſe approved or made uſe of then other humane Writings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we cannot but wonder at three things: Firſt, that you ſhould equal thoſe Books to other humane Writings, without any diſcrimination; for you know that ſome humane Writings are prophane, ſome meerly fabulous, ſome obſcene, ſome impious, ſome blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and ſome Atheiſtical.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that you ſhould give the Books (in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall commonly called Apocryphal) no preheminence above other humane Writings, ſince you know that they cannot only plead their Antiquity, but Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſervation; that the Church and Saints have bin their Treaſurers and Library keepers, that they have been bound up and tranſlated in various Languages with the other Oracles of God, which by all are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Canonicall, that they have been allowed and appointed to be read not only in private but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly: Nor are you ignorant what an high eſteem both Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and other Fathers had of them above all humane Writings, though they did not hold them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115397:22"/>every way with thoſe commonly called Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, we marvail that you ſhould uſe no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all concerning theſe Books, but paſs the ſame cenſure upon them all alike: Since that the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> or <hi>Tobias</hi> is extant in the Hebrew, as wel as Greek and Latin; the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> was tranſlated out of the Hebrew text, by <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sirach,</hi> as himſelf confeſſeth. This Book, with the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> breaths forth ſuch a ſpirit of Wiſdom and Holineſs, that it may be ſaid, <hi>Non vox hominem ſonat,</hi> that it tranſcends all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacity. To ſay nothing that the words which the Apoſtle hath, <hi>Hebrews</hi> chap. 1. verſ 3. <hi>Who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs Image of his perſon,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to be taken out of the 7 chap. of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> verſ 26. theſe words, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.5. <hi>That he had pleaſed God,</hi> are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 4.10. compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2 with <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 3.8. More eſpecially, the fourth Book of <hi>Eſdras</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Faber,</hi> and many more learned men to be written by inſpirement of the Holy Ghoſt. It is owned as Canonicall by diverſe holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of later times. Our Saviour cites theſe words, which are written, Mat. 23.37, 38 <hi>How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate;</hi> out of the ſecond Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> chap. 1. verſ 30. Many things ſhewed to St <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> are found in that Book. It is doubtleſs a moſt lively prediction of theſe laſt times; and the great famine, and generall deſolation ſpoken of in the laſt Chapter, which is now in his accompliſhment, will ere long convince all the world that this Book is, or ſhould be Canonicall.</p>
                  <p>When you ſhal ſhortly ſee three Emperours at once in Europe, one ſet up by the Pope, another by the Princes and People, and then the great Turk uſurping that place and dignity, think upon <hi>Eſdras</hi> his viſion of the Eagle with three heads, Chap. 11.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115397:23"/>Thirdly, Whereas you ſay in the ſixth Section, <q>That nothing at any time is to be added to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament, whether by new relations of the Spirit, or Traditions of men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We deſire to know what warrant you have thus to determine. If you ſay that <hi>Rev.</hi> 22 18. it is written, <hi>that if any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer, that ſo much in effect was forbidden long before, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Add thou not unto his words, leaſt be reprove thee, and thou be found a lier:</hi> Yet many Books of the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles have been added ſince the written word of thoſe times, yea the ſame inhibition was given by <hi>Moſes: Deut.</hi> 4.2. and 12, 32. <hi>Ye ſhall not add to the word which I command you, neither ſhall you dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ought from it.</hi> Therefore this addition thus prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of any new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in ſubſtance differing from the Old, even that of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that there ſhould be a vindication of the ſame when miſunderſtood, or a more full and free publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, by the Prophets of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or inſpired men of the New, is not interdicted, but rather promiſed.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the whole Counſel of God, concerning the glorifying of God and mans ſalvation, is revealed in the New-Teſtament, and ſo it was even in the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch of <hi>Moſes; Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>The ſecret things belong to the Lord our God; but thoſe things which are revealed belong to us and to our Children for ever, that we may do the words of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now look what reaſons can be rendered why new books of Holy Scripture ſhould be written after <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> by the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and after both by the Prophets and Apoſtles of the New
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115397:23"/>Teſtament, and the ſelf ſame will plead for other Scriptures to be yet written after both.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid that the Devil in time brought in a falſe underſtanding of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo corrupted both the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical Eſtate, and therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Prophets ſhould be raiſed up to cleer the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes;</hi> to reprove Princes, Prieſts, and Prophets; to reſtore the Truth and worſhip of God; and to foretell things to come, whether good or evil, &amp;c. And that in proceſs of time, when Satan had corrupted <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets with falſe gloſſes, perverted the civil Government, defiled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Firſt, Whether Satan that old and malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of all truths and goodneſs be not alive, and as vigilant and active, as heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether it was not foretold even in the New Teſtament, that there ſhould be a departure from the Faith as before, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18 8. <hi>That there ſhould be falſe Teachers in the laſt daies, who pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies even denying the Lord that bought them:</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Jude</hi> in his Epiſtle teſtifies alſo: <hi>That the whole Book of God ſhould become a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Book, Rev.</hi> 5.1. &amp;c. <hi>That a ſmoake aſcending out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, ſhould darken the Sun and the Air, Rev.</hi> 9.2. That the two witneſſes which propheſie in ſackcloath a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore daies or years (which can be no other then the two Teſtaments, as moſt ſpiritual men conclude) were to be ſlain &amp; depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of light and life for a time: <hi>Rev.</hi> 11 8, to 12. <hi>That ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhould ſo abound, that all love and true goodneſs ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: Matthew</hi> 24.12. 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115397:24"/>That there ſhould be falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, which ſhould preach thoſe Chriſts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. That Antichriſt the ſon of perdition ſhould fit in the Temple of God, as if he were God, or Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. &amp;c. And finally, that for the moſt part the viſible Church, with her ſeverall Sects, ſhould become a great Harlot, calling her ſelf the Spouſe of Chriſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Whoredomes daily againſt Him, his holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and righteous Life and Kingdom (which ſhould be orabide in us) being full of names of Blaſphemy, the moſt wicked of every Sect or Profeſſion calling themſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Thirdly, whether Chriſt himſelf ſhall not come again in the Spirit to reveal Antichriſt, to conſume him with the Spirit of his mouth, and to deſtroy him with the brightneſs of his coming, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. <hi>To binde Satan, and ſeal him up in the bottomleſs pit, that he deceive not the Nations,</hi> as before, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.1, 2. and to ſhorten the dayes of ſeducement, contention, and mutuall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Churches, <hi>for the Elect ſake, leſt no fleſh ſhould bee ſaved,</hi> Mat. 24.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whether the Goſpel is not to be preached anew to the whole world after all this ignorance, error, and corruption brought in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12, 13, 14. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the love of many ſhall grow cold; but he that endureth unto the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved. And this Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall bee preached in all the World, for a witneſs to all Nations; and then ſhall the end come,</hi> to wit, the end of Babylon, or of the falſe and wicked Jeruſalem of the Gentiles, ſpoken of in that Chapter under the type of the former proud, factious, contentious, bloody, Chriſt-murthering City, of which Chriſt took occaſion to ſpeak, Verſ 1, 2. Nor was this univerſall publication of the Goſpel fulfilled in the Apoſtles days, but was foreſhewed to St <hi>John</hi> as a thing yet to com, Re. 14, 6, 7. <hi>And I ſaw another Angel flying in the midſt of heaven having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach to them

                  <p>Fifthly, Whether there ſhall not another <hi>Elias</hi> ariſe after <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to prepare the way for Chriſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual coming, to purge and renue the earth, and to judge and govern the world in righteouſneſs, according to manifold promiſes and propheſies, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Micah</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>Jſa.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and <hi>chap.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14, 27. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.1, 9.

                  <p>Sixthly, Whether there ſhall not in time be a cleerer and more free diſpenſation of all truths after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes, then in thoſe or any former times. <hi>Luk</hi> 12.3. <hi>Therefore whatſoever ye have ſpoken in darkneſs, ſhall be heard in the light; and that which ye have ſpoken in the ear and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, ſhall be proclaimed upon the houſe topps.</hi>

                  <p>But to conclude this point, let us entreat you of the Synod, if you have any Germanes ſitting among you, to enquire of them, or others, what inſpired men, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to be ſuch, even of their Nation, have written any Goſpel to the whole world within ſix ſcore yeares laſt paſt? and whether ſome one of them hath not written more then all the Books of the New Teſtament amount to? If ſo, it may concern them, you, and us to finde them out, to read them with diligence, and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt prayer to God for true enlightening judgement and guidance, to compare and examine them not with the Writings of men bee they who they will; but with and by the Holy Scriptures themſelves: for the Holy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115397:25"/>Ghoſt cannot contradict it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If we finde upon due ſearch any ſuch grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vouchſafed to this laſt age, it may ſhew the true cauſe why <hi>Germany</hi> (before and above all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) according to that Acts 3.22, 23. hath bin plagued; and alſo afford us a preſent mean and expedient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all controverſies in Religion may be decided from Gods own mouth, and hold forth a true Modell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all Churches and Commonwealths by. <hi>Sed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ſat Sapientibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, in the tenth Section of this Chapter, you ſay; <q>The ſupreme Judge by which all controverſies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councels, opinions of Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Doctrines of men and private Spirits are to bee examined, and in whoſe ſentence we are to reſt; can be no other but the holy Spirit ſpeaking in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you had added theſe words to <hi>private Spirits,</hi> even <hi>publique Spirits</hi> alſo, or pretending to be ſuch, we would have cloſed with you in that enumeration, and have acknowledged that the Holy Ghoſt, (yet left at large) muſt be the only ſupreme Judge, to wit, either ſpeaking in the holy Scripture, or without it, although in all his determinations of Doctrine he doth ſpeak according to former Scriptures; And hence it is, that for the tryall of Spirits in his dayes, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſends men <hi>to the Law and the Teſtimony, Iſa.</hi> 8.20. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits men to the former Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. And the Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets. And accordingly for the tryall of new or late profeſſing Prophets, we are to examine their Doctrine by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writings of the Old and New-Teſtament; but not by our own, or our private Authors corrupt and darkned Iudgments.

                  <p>Your failings are here ſpecially two; Firſt, you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your ſelves, and contradict what you have ſpoken before in your deſcribing of Gods holy nature; and Secondly, you diſtinguiſh not things, but differ very much, as,</p>

And then ſecondly, of men, and that in a twofold eſtate: For in the ſtate of Innocency they were ordained to life in caſe of perſeverance in obedience, and the retention of God's Image in which they were created. And ſecondly, after their fall, in caſe they imbrace the grace that ſhall be offered, and fulfil the conditions or requiring of the ſame. And betwixt God's ſpecial Election of ſome perſons, both Angels and men out of foreſeen perſeverance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Betwixt the ſpecial Election of God, which is from eternity, out of foreſeen Faith, Love, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115397:31"/>Perſeverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that which is made in time actually; and that is either conditional, as of thoſe which (by regeneration) are called out of the ſinful eſtate, wherein other men are yet captived; and ſo all called ones are ſaid to be choſen: <hi>John</hi> 15.16, 19. and Election in this notion is all one with calling: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Wherefore the rather Brethren, give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Which perſons are choſen or called to life, conditionally, that they perſevere in Faith and Obedience, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God; towards them that fell ſeverity; but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: therwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> Or elſe the Election of God in time is abſolute, ſuch was the Election and choice of the bleſſed Angels, after their perſeverance in the fear and love of God, when others had fallen therefrom.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch is the Election of men ſpoken of by the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.10. <hi>Behold I have choſen thee in the furnace of affliction.</hi> Theſe have fulfilled the conditions aforeſaid of peſeverance in Faith, Obedience, and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore were abſolutely and finally choſen to eternal life. Theſe are the Elect that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and who ſhall never fall.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Betwixt ſome that were onely typically Elected, or paſſed by in God's providence, as figures and repreſentatives of thoſe which ſhould be ſaved or periſh; as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> the two ſons of <hi>Abrab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> were, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7. without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the ſalvation of either. And thoſe which are really elected or rejected; For as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> were debarred entrance into the land of promiſe, for their doubting or unbelief, for a warning to all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, <hi>Heb</hi> 4.1.11. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. yet without any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of their own excluſion from eternal life (none (that we know of) making the leaſt doubt of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſo it was not prejudicial to the ſalvation of <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> (his father <hi>Abraham</hi> having obtained life for him by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115397:31"/>his prayer to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 20, 21.) that he carried the type of thoſe who ſhould not be heirs of life; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and peradventure the like may be ſaid of the perſon of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who at the meeting of his brother <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was turned into another man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4. and did ever after ſweetly accord with him, although <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.16. he carries the type of a ſpiritual fornicator and profane perſon that ſels his eternal birthright for a morſel of meat here in this world: and of him that loſing his firſt grace or bleſſing, obtaines not a ſecond. But here we would not be miſunderſtood; for though we brought <hi>Iſaac</hi> as an inſtance of a typical or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeed, which he was in oppoſition to <hi>Iſhmael, Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7. yet we do not deny, but that he was one really elected out of Gods ſpecial foreknowledge; nor do we doubt but <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might be ſo likewiſe: howſoever he was generally and conditionally elected, as was alſo <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.6, 7. where the Lord ſaith unto him, <hi>Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Betwixt theſe that are unchangeably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to life or death out of foreſeen faith or unbelief, perſeverance or Apoſtacy; and thoſe that are abſolutely and peremptorily without any condition or reſpect to ſtanding or falling, riſing again through grace or lieing ſtill, retaining or loſing grace received: For after this laſt manner none are irrevocably deſigned either to life or death from all eternity, among Angels or men.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Betwixt a ſoveraign power inveſted in a moſt wiſe, juſt, gratious, loving, and merciful Prince, which may be uſed to his greater glory; and the ſame placed in a rigourous and cruel Tyrant: which laſt to affix upon God is no ſmall degree of blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Betwixt an abſolute preterition of ſome from eternity, before they have done, or thought good or evil, yea had any being, (which is not found in God towards any of his future rational creatures) and a paſſing over of ſome in time for their perſonal ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115397:32"/>and contumacy againſt him, as the fallen Angels are declined after their fall, and ſome men after grace often refuſed, and others after grace abuſed are leſt to walk in their own wayes.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Betwixt the not extending of grace at all after a needleſs and wilful Apoſtacy, (as the Lord dealt with the proud and preſumptuous Angels which fell) and the withholding of mercy from ſome perſons which were not ſo ſtrongly and well ſituated in grace, and which fell through the temptation of others; and thus God withholds not his firſt grace, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alſo a ſufficient grace, from any of the ſons of men, though they are fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, Betwixt the withholding the firſt, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace from fallen men, which is not kept back for any till they reſiſt it; and the withdrawing of his ſecond or ſubſequent grace from ſuch as have wilfully caſt off the firſt, in the juſt requiring of it, and ſo do deſpite of the Spirit of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Theſe few neceſſary diſtinctions being firſt premiſed we proceed. Now for your errors and miſtakes in your ſeveral Sections; Firſt, we ſay that your aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſecond Section is very falſe and erroneous, where you ſay; That, <q>Although God knows what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may or can come to paſs upon all ſuppoſed conditions, yet hath he not decreed any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he foreſaw it as future, or as that which ſhould come to paſs upon ſuch conditions:</q> For did not the Lord foreſee that if he created the Angels free Agents, ſome would fall, and others ſtand ſtill in their integrity? That if he created our firſt parents with liberty of will, that they would fall; That if he offered fallen men his grace to help them up again, ſome would embrace it, and ſome refuſe it. That his offered grace being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, ſome which received it would perſevere, and fulfil thoſe conditions, and ſome would fail in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance after they had begun well. That <hi>Judas</hi> being returned to his former covetouſneſs would betray his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115397:32"/>Maſter for gain. That the Jews out of obſtinacy and envy would condemn, and deliver Chriſt to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. That <hi>Pilate</hi> out of favour to men would yeeld him up to be ſcourged and crucified: All which, and a thouſand things more, the Lord foreſaw would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally or ſuppoſedly come to paſs, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon decree or determine that they ſhould ſo do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could turn them to his glory; yet do we not ſay, that the Lord was neceſſitated ſo to do alwayes; but when he foreſaw that the effects and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ariſing out of ſuch ſuppoſed conditions, were not conducible to his wiſe and holy ends; he both could, and in time did put a ſtop thereunto, at his pleaſure. Thus he foreſaw that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> out of their wicked and ingrateful diſpoſition (being left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) would deliver and betray <hi>David</hi> into the hands of <hi>Saul;</hi> and therefore he did both decree not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, and did actually hinder it, by advertifing <hi>David</hi> of it that he might timely eſcape.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section there is truth and error to be found, accordingly as your words are taken; for you ſpeak generally and ambiguouſly ſaying, <q>By God's Decree for the manifeſtation of his glory, ſome men and Angels are predeſtinated unto eternal life, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fore-ordained to everlaſting death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we anſwer thus; Firſt, That men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are not in all things, and every way diſpoſed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in God's eternal Decree. For though no fallen Angels are ordained to life, yet by your own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many fallen men are appointed to ſalvation in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſay that all both men and Angels are firſt predeſtinated to eternal life, in caſe they ſhould continue in their firſt created eſtate by anſwerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. The truth whereof appears ſufficiently in the confirmation, and bleſſing of thoſe holy Angels which perſiſted in their allegiance, who are therefore called the <hi>Elect Angels.</hi>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:115397:34"/>Thirdly, We affirm, that all men, though fallen, are appointed to reſtauration and life by grace condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that they beleeve on that grace, and obey its requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. <hi>have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die ſaith the Lord; and that not he ſhould return and live? Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Say unto them, as I live ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of the wicked.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.3, 4. <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Whereunto add that of <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. which holds forth both the univerſality of grace it ſelf, and its condition, <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, Teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> But laſtly, we grant notwithſtanding that ſome both Angels and men were appointed for deſtruction, yet conditionally through their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault and diſobedience, as the Apoſtles ſhew both of the one and of the other; and firſt of the Angels; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down into Hell.</hi> Jude 6. <hi>And the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in everlaſting chaines under darkneſs to the judgement of the great day.</hi> And ſecondly concerning men, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That all might be damned who beleeve not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> Now theſe and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures by us alledged, do not ſpeak immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of Gods eternal Decree; yet we know, that God works all things in time, according to the counſel of his own will from eternity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section you declare your ſelves more fully in this point of Predeſtination, ſaying, <q>Theſe Angels and men thus Predeſtinated and fore ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are particularly and unchangeably deſigned, and their number is ſo certain and definite, that it cannot be either encreaſed or diminiſhed.</q> Which words of yours we will grant to be true: Firſt of the Angels after ſome had ſtood faſt in obedience, and others had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115397:34"/>fallen; but this was a deſtination in time, not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination from eternity. Secondly, Of Angels and men out of the ſpecial fore-knowledge of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he certainly foreſaw the perſeverance of the good Angels in obedience, when the wicked ſpirits fell: as alſo the perſiſtance of the Saints in faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards grace which ſhould be exhibited, on the one hand, with the Apoſtacy of the lapſed Angels, and the obſtinacy of the impenitent men, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding temporaries on the other hand, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly determined that the one part ſhould be ſaved, and the other periſh. But that Gods decree in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, toward Angels and men was onely conditional, and did no wayes neceſſitate either to ſin and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to obedience and ſalvation; it is evident out of theſe enſuing texts, and many more: As for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels the fault of their Apaſtacy is wholly and clearly aſcribed to themſelves, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And as for men, it is ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and Lawyers did fruſtrate the counſel of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which things would not poſſibly be done unleſs God's counſel was conditional; add 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>But God is long-ſuffering to us ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance:</hi> which is ſpoken aſwel of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula generum,</hi> as of <hi>genera ſingulorum,</hi> and you had before God's oath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> To confirm his affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.23. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die?</hi> And as there is no enforcing neceſſity from Gods decree to diſpoſe Angels and men to obedience or diſobedience, life or death: ſo neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny neceſſity of nature, that is want, of liberty in their wills, or inability to obey before their fall, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there is left afterwards in mankinde.</p>
                  <p>But if you mean by this particular and unchangeable deſigning men and Angels, an abſolute, irreſpective, and peremtorie or inevitable diſpoſe of ſome Angels and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115397:35"/>men to life, and of others to deſtruction, and that from eternity; you do not onely make God a reſpecter of perſons in thoſe that are appointed to life, from which the Scripture vindicates the Lord frequently, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Rom</hi> 2.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts what you ſpeak concerning God, Chapter the ſecond, where you deſcribe him to be <q>moſt wiſe, moſt holy, moſt loving moſt gratious, moſt merciful, and moſt righteous, &amp;c.</q> When you aſcribe to him ſuch a peremtory and irrevocable Decree of condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thouſands of Angels and men everlaſtingly, and that before they had done, or purpoſed any evil againſt him, or yet had any being. Conſider this we pray you, could any of you which is a father (and ſcarce hath one drop of love, mercy and goodneſs, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with God's ocean) appoint one or more of your little babes (which yet never offended you) to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death? How far then muſt it be from the gratious diſpoſition of him that is love it ſelf, and whoſe bowels of Compaſſion are infinite, inevitably to deſigne ſo many millions of Angels (his children by creation) to endleſs and inſufferable flames of fire, before they had any exiſtence in nature, or capacity of offending?</p>
                  <p>In your Fifth Section, you ſay, that <q>thoſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde that are predeſtinated unto life, are choſen by God before the foundation of the world was laid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eternal and immutable purpoſe, and the ſecret counſel and good pleaſure of his will in Chriſt unto everlaſting glory,</q> out of his meer free grace and love. All which is true both of Gods gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpecial election. But whereas you add theſe words in concluſion without any foreſight of Faith, or good works or perſeverance in either of them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or cauſes moving him thereunto: It is a moſt dangerous error and falſehood. For was not that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God which <hi>Paul</hi> declared to the Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27. briefly comprehended in that Doctrine, whereby (as he himſelf ſaith) he teſtified <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In your ſeventh Section you come to Gods preteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, <q>The reſt of mankinde God hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the unſerchable councel of his own will, whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy, as he pleaſeth, for the glory of his ſoveraign power over his creatures, to paſs by and to ordain them to diſhonour and wrath for ther ſin, to the praiſe of his glorious juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here We pray you give us leave to propound theſe Queries to you. Firſt, who are the reſt of mankinde of whom you ſpeak? Are they all thoſe who are not elected? But we have ſhewed before that all are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115397:37"/>in general upon condition. Did not God make his Covenant of Grace with all mankinde in <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, and afterwards for them with <hi>Noah? Gen.</hi> 9.8, 9. Yea, he covenanted with <hi>Abraham</hi> for all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Nations, and People, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. and 18 18. and that with an oath. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22: 16, 17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. Whereupon all Nations, yea, all people are called upon to praiſe the Lord for this his great merciful kindneſs, and for the truth of his promiſe which endureth for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 117.1, 2. which being undoubtedly true, there can be none of mankinde paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over from eternity.</p>
                  <p>But if you mean that All, but thoſe final and ſpecial choſen ones before mentioned, are paſſed over from eternity, without any purpoſe of grace or mercy to be extended towards them in Jeſus Chriſt: your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not onely falſe, but moſt dangerous. For, <hi>God is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Gods counſel herein be unſearchable, how came you to know it?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Since it is clear that Gods merciful kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is towards all men as before, and that he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. who are they from whom he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, or to whom he extendeth not mercy? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they can be no other, but ſuch as thruſt it away from them, firſt or laſt, at leaſt wiſe in its conditions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. <hi>Then</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>waxed bold, and ſaid, It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing you put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, we turn to the Gentiles,</hi> Prov. 1.24, 5, 26. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded: but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I will alſo laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Fourthly, Is not God's Soveraign power placed in one that is both moſt righteous, and alſo moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and not in tyrannical hands?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Is not that ſoveraign power moſt glorified in puniſhing offendors after mercy hath been offered; and contemned or rejected?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If theſe be paſſed over for their ſins, as you affirm; How could this preterition be from eternity? For men ſinned not till they were.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If it were for ſins, what ſins did better deſerve ſuch a preterition then mens own perſonal and actual ſins; yea, then their contempt and contumacy againſt grace offered?</p>
                  <p>Eighthly. If this preterition was for the praiſe of God's glorious juſtice, muſt not his juſtice firſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and conſpicuous in this his paſſing by them? But he accounts it neither honorable for him that the Son ſhould die for the ſin of the Father; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 20. nor yet juſt, for he hath forbidden the ſelf ſame thing in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.16.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Is there no difference betwixt a veſſel of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, and a veſſel of wrath? Many veſſels are made by the Potter for diſhonorable uſes; yet none of ſet purpoſe for deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Your Caution in the laſt Section is very good, where you ſay, that, <q>The Doctrine of the high myſtery of Predeſtination is to be handled with ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his word, and yeelding obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual vocation,</q> be aſſured of their eternal election: Where you ſhould have added, and from their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in that obedience till the death of ſin, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their ſpiritual, final, and everlaſting election: there being a twofold election from eternity as hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But this caution of yours, you your ſelves have not

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115397:40"/>Fourthly, The Apoſtles mentions this diſpoſal of them beforehand, to prove that <hi>Jacob's</hi> or <hi>Iſrael's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment was of meer grace, and ſo the Argument was apt for his diſcourſe in that book, where he aſſerts God's grace againſt our own natural works and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is in this ſubordination of <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> a ſpiritual document, ſhewing that no natural or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man muſt be ſubject to the ſpiritual or heavenly man, for <hi>Edom</hi> ſignifies earthly.</p>
                  <p>Object. 11. Rom. 9.13. <hi>As it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have</hi> I <hi>loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated.</hi> It ſhould ſeem then that the perſon of <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated before hand, and <hi>Jacob</hi> alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some indeed have ſo underſtood the Apoſtle, and have run themſelves and others thereby upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rocks, not conſidering thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Where thoſe words are written, to wit, not <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. as the other is, but <hi>Mala.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Prophet ſpake not of the perſon of <hi>Jacob,</hi> where he ſaith to <hi>Iſrael verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you;</hi> and again, <hi>yet I loved</hi> Jacob: but of the ſeed and poſterity of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That in the third verſe the Lord ſpeakes of the poſterity of <hi>Eſan</hi> in that very age, and not of the perſon of <hi>Eſau:</hi> Where he ſaith, <hi>And I hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and laid his mountains and his heritage waſte for the dragons of the wilderneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Lord ſhews the cauſe in the 4. ver. why he hath hated <hi>Edom</hi> at this time; It was for their incorrigible wickedneſs, ſaying, <hi>Whereas</hi> Edom <hi>ſaith we are impoveriſhed, but we will return and build the deſolate places: They ſhall build, but I will through down; and they ſhall call them the border of wickedneſs, and the people againſt whom the Lord hath indignation for-ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Apoſtle alledgeth this place, to ſhew that what God had ſpoken concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s preheminence above <hi>Edoms, Gen.</hi> 25.23. was now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115397:41"/>they continuing to be his people, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were caſt off for their obſtinacy.</p>
                  <p>Object. 12. Rom. 9.14, 15. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid. For he ſaith to Moſes. I will have mercy, on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion, on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> It ſeems then that there are ſome upon whom the Lord will not have compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, there are ſome ſuch perſons; and ſuch were the incorrigible Edomites, before ſpoken off: yet note three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Apoſtle preoccupates an Objection, which ſome might make, out of Gods mercy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but withdrawn from <hi>Edom,</hi> as before, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Apoſtle anſwers it, not onely with a deteſtation, ſaying <hi>God forbid,</hi> but alſo with a Scripture taken out of <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.9. <hi>And I will be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to whom I will be gratious, and I will ſhew mercy, to whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Lord ſpeakes there of continuing and enlarging his after mercies and favours to thoſe that walk humbly, faithfully, and anſwerably to his firſt mercy or grace, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done then, when he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the Lord that he would ſhew him his glory: And not of his firſt grace, withholden from none. Whereby the contrary it may be gathered, that God will withhold his ſecond mercies from ſome, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his firſt grace, as the Edomites had done, or ſhould abuſe the ſame afterwards by <hi>turning his grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, Jude</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Object, 13, Rom. 9.16. <hi>So then it is not of him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Our ſalvation then is of meer mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is granted ſo to be, yet by the way note, that man can both wil, and run in ſome ſort as this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture imports.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115397:41"/>Object. 14. Rom. 9.17, 18. <hi>For the Scripture ſaith unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore hath he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, note that here the Lord doth not ſay, for this ſame purpoſe have I <hi>created thee,</hi> but <hi>raiſed thee up,</hi> or <hi>brought thee upon the ſtage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was known to the Lord to be a proud and obſtinate Rebel, before he thus called him out, <hi>Exod</hi> 5.2. <hi>And Pharoah ſaid, who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice to let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That yet the Lord gives him to know his will, and gratiouſly ſhews him the danger of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, before he ſends his plagues upon him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That he leaves him not, till he made him, of unwilling, willing to let his people go.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That God did not harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart by infuſing any hardneſs into it, but rather uſed means to ſoften and bend his heart to obedience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Lord deſtroyed him not, till his heart byaſed, and wilfully revolted from that inclination of letting <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, to which the Lord had brought and wrought him. So that the Lords pleaſure in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom he will; muſt out of this example be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch as are firſt or laſt refractory againſt his grace, and gratious requirings, monitions. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. 15. Rom, 9.19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay, why doth he yet finde fault? Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> It ſeems then his will in condemning the wicked is irreſiſtable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The will of God is manifold, Firſt, <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> that which he would have done by men, and that may be reſiſted or diſobeyed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> that which he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to effect, and that either abſolutely to be done by himſelf alone, or with others, which cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115397:42"/>or conditionally, in caſe the creature will act his part. This conditional will may alſo be repugned, ſo that wicked men cannot excuſe themſelves by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibility of the firſt or laſt mentioned will. There is alſo the unchangeable will of God's irrevocable decree, at length paſſed upon the obſtinate and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible ſinner, which like his powerful or efficacious will is inexpugnable. But it is the obdurate mans refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and inflexible will that hath now made this will or decree of God ſo peremptory againſt him. So that God hath juſt cauſe to fault and blame the man that periſheth, but not <hi>è contra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. 16. Rom. 9.20. <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Whence it may ſeem to follow, that God makes the loſt ones ſuch as they are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> intends nothing leſs then to lay any ſuch aſperſion upon God, who is onely the Author of their deſerved puniſhment; but not of their ſins, unleſs of ſuch as are juſt and ſevere compenſations of their former contumacies. Indeed the Apoſtle here firſt takes up theſe murmurers for their audacious and preſumptuous obloquies againſt their Maker, in this verſe: <hi>Nay but O man who art thou that replyeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> And then in the three next verſes for the total ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of their obmurmuration, he aſſerts firſt Gods ſoveraign power <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. and then his juſtice <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. with his mercy alſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. If the wicked then finding themſelves loſt, at length ſhould cavil againſt God, and ſay why did he create me with liberty of will and ſo with a power of falling? It is anſwered, that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty might be improved to the ſalvation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as to the glory of Gods grace, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. Or why did God give us any being, ſince we muſt be wretched and unhappy for ever? It is anſwered. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. that it coming to paſs meerly through their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault and wilfulneſs, it was free for our Soveraign
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115397:42"/>Lord thus to glorifie his power and juſtice againſt ſuch rebels, yea, and his incurable enemies alſo.</p>
                  <p>Object. 17. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the ſame lumpe to make one veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> It ſeems then that God makes ſome veſſels of purpoſe unto diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. It is certain that God is a wiſe Potter, and not a workman that never had wiſdom, or hath loſt his witts. Now ſuch a Potter though he (as the event falls out afterwards) makes many veſſels to be broken, yet forms none of ſet purpoſe for deſtruction, as we ſaid before: Some veſſels indeed are made by him for more honourable uſes, as Salt-ſellers, drinking-cups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome for more diſhonorable uſes, for Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots &amp; the like, but none to be deſtroyed; for that were to loſe his labour. And ſo hath the Lord appointed both in Church &amp; Common-Wealth, ſome to be ſuperiours and ſome inferiours as hath been ſhewed, but none of the ſons of men hath he made of purpoſe to perdition.</p>
                  <p>II. It is evident enough that the Apoſtle alludeth to <hi>Jeremie</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. Where obſerve theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Prophet being ſent to the Potters houſe, he found that the veſſel in the Potters hand firſt miſcarried, and was marred, repreſenting man not in the pure but corrupt maſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Potter took pains to make it up a new, or other veſſel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Lord expoſtulates with <hi>Iſrael</hi> for not ſuffering him to mould them a new, as that Potter had done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Lord forms not men anew by force or violence, as the Potter did the ſenſeleſs clay, but works upon them as rational creatures, and free Agents, by perſwading them and drawing them, as is evident from the 7. <hi>verſe</hi> to the 12. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation and concerning a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115397:43"/>Laſtly, That the better a veſſel is that is ſo made out of a depraved lump, the more honour it is for the work man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Object. 18. Rom. 9, 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, indured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction?</hi> Whence ſome collect that it is God that hath ſo fitted them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, It is not ſaid that they were created, but fitted for deſtruction <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not ſo much as implyed, much leſs affirmed that they were ſo fitted by the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The clear contrary is imported, where it is ſaid, that he hath <hi>with much or great long ſufferance endured theſe veſſels of wrath.</hi> For if God created or deſigned them purpoſely for deſtruction, things had ſucceeded according to his own hearts deſire when they went on in fin and rebellion: but in as much as he heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired their repentance and return in order to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: hence it was that he bear their multiplyed provocations, and their contumacies againſt his grace with much irkſomneſs and long ſufferance, the end whereof was ſalvation, as the Apoſtles teach, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p>Object. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared unto glory.</hi> Whence it may ſeem that God hath prepared theſe veſſels from eternity for this their glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Note firſt, That no ſuch veſſels ſince the fall; can be veſſels of glory, till they be prepared thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that is, purged from corruption, and renued, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the preparing and fitting of theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the main part and power of the work, is attributed to God in expreſs tearms, and ſo was not the fitting of the veſſels of wrath aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this preparing of the veſſels of glory
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115397:43"/>is ſaid to precede glory; but it is not here attributed to Gods eternal decree.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That both the glory, and the preparation of the veſſels thereunto, is of grace, and ſo ordained, to Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Object. 20. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Epiſt. 1. Chap. 2. ver. 7.8. <hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is granted that ſome were fore ordained thereunto, (and that it was foretold alſo that they ſhould do ſo, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.14.) yet neither ſimply, nor yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely or irreſpectively; but as their puniſhment for their former pride upon their own ſelf conceited wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, holineſs, and righteouſneſs; and for their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy alſo.

For it is uſual that former ſins, eſpecially a refractary diſpoſition, ſhould be plagued with after and ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perverſeneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81 11.12. <hi>But my people would not bearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me: So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own councels.</hi> Read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25.32. And the like anſwer we give to that place of St <hi>Jude,</hi> verſe 4. <hi>For there are certain men crept in among you, who were before of old ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into laciviouſneſs, and denying the onely Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap>, <hi>this condemnation,</hi> ſhews it to be a puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, The cauſe of <hi>this condemnation</hi> is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the words following, <hi>ungodly men they were,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all the principal <hi>Objections</hi> which we could now call to minde and we hope (though briefly and

                  <p>Anſwer. It may be ſo, yet are theſe neither one entire world, nor were all theſe things created in the ſpace of ſix dayes, as you untruly affirm.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Angels world called by our Saviour and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Paradiſe, Luke</hi> 23.43. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 4. and this preſent world, are not one entire, but two remote and diſtinct worlds, it is evident out of the words of our bleſſed Savior, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. But <hi>whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> Luk. 20.34, 5.36. <hi>And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto them, the children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: but they that ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage, neither can they die any more, for they are equall to the Angels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Nor were the Angels and their heavens created within the ſpace of thoſe ſix dayes, wherein all things of this world were made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1—but long before. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain that <hi>Moſes</hi> makes no mention of them in the narration, and hiſtory of thoſe ſix dayes workes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Eſdras</hi> in his ſecond Book (of which we ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſaith expreſly <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That Gods right hand planted Paradiſe before ever the earth came forward, and that he having created man in time did lead him into it.</hi> Nor doth he alone ſpeak this, that the Angels were exiſtent before the creation of this world; but the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo, <hi>Job</hi> 38.4. <hi>Where waſt thyou when I laid the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth?</hi> and then followes, <hi>When the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stars ſang together, and the ſons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> So that thoſe ſons of God (who are at all hands confeſſed to be the Holy Angels) were preſent and glorified
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115397:46"/>God when he laid the firſt foundation of this world. Nor is it improbable (which ſome late prophetical men affirm) that man was created in the room of the faln Angels, which ſo much the more ſtirred up the envy of the Devil againſt him. Certain it is that the wicked Angels were not only pre-exiſtent, but had faln alſo from their firſt eſtate, before man was created.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

But whether the Lord uſed the miniſtry of theſe Spirits in the creation of this world, as he doth in the government of the ſame, we will not diſpute. Howſoever it was the unanimous conſent of moſt of the Greek fathers (if not of them all) and the aſſertion of divine <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and of <hi>Jerom</hi> among the Latines, that the creation of Angels did precede the making of this world, and that upon theſe grounds before alledged, among many other.</p>
                  <p>After you have ſpoken of this world in general, you come to the compoſure of the creature for whoſe ſake this world was eſpecially made, even mankinde; where according to holy Scriptures we finde another world, not only becauſe man is ſtiled a Microcoſme, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is this ſpiritual and glorious workmanſhip of God (though to the world and her wiſe ones inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) called a world in the Old Teſtament alone, but in the New alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if any hearing of more worlds, be ſorry with <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he hath taken ſo much travaile for one, growing ambitious to have the other alſo, let him firſt by faith, obedience, prayer, and all other good means ſeek to get the inward and ſpirituall world planted, and created in him, and upon him, by the grace and power of Chriſt; and he may be in the better poſſibility of the third and higheſt world, and prove an heir of Paradiſe with the bleſſed Angels.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115397:47"/>For as the Lord himſelf proceeded gradually, firſt to that creation which was ſpiritual and inviſible; and then to that which was viſible and corporeal: ſo let the ſons of men (now faln and corrupted) turn from the outward creature, get the inward world of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and holineſs, and ſo gradually tend towards the world Angelical, that they may proceed from glory to glory.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter not without a ſpecimen or document of Gods divine providence, you have teſtified many things as rightly and truly, ſo with reverence and honor to that wiſe and holy adminiſtration of his; yet in two things we crave leave briefly to ſhew you your defects; yet not ſo great or blameable as ſome of your former failings. Firſt then, in your ſecond Section, you affirm, <q>That although in relation to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and decree of God (the firſt cauſe) all things come to paſs immutably and infallibly; yet by the ſame providence he ordereth them to fall out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the ſecond cauſes either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, freely, or contingently.</q> Where firſt you ſeem to us to make Gods providence not only to jar with his decree, but even to thwart the ſame; For this laſt orders many things to come to paſs contingently and freely, as you ſay, whereas the former appoints all things to come to paſs immutably. It is granted that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115397:49"/>all things come to paſs infallibly in regard of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God: but we cannot ſee how all things ſhould come to paſs immutably, ſince many things are decreed but conditionally, as we have ſhewed <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and here you confeſs that all things do not come to paſs neceſſarily, which they muſt neceſſarily do, if all things be immutably decreed; but it is evident that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees both good and evil towards men Hypothetically, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, to pull down and to deſtroy; If that Nation againſt whom I have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them;. And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdom to build and to plant: If it doe evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid, I would benefit them.</hi> So verſ. 11.12. Rom. 8.13. and 11.22, 23. How could Gods counſel be made voide by men (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30.) if it were immutable in it ſelf, as you affirm?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In your ſixth Section you ſay, <q>As for thoſe wicked and ungodly, whom God as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, for former ſins, doth blinde and harden; from them he not onely withdraweth his grace, whereby they might have been enlightned in their underſtandings, and wrought upon in their hearts, but alſo ſometimes withdraweth the gifts which they had,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Wherein, beſides that you mention not the maine (if not onely) ſin, for which God leaves men to themſelves, to wit, mens ſhutting their eyes againſt his monitions, commandements and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: you ſeem to lay ſome default upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying, <q>That he withholdeth that grace from them, whereby their hearts, that is, their wils and affections might have been wrought upon,</q> which both derogates from Gods mercy and is inconſiſtent which innumerable Scriptures teſtifying the contrary, as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could I have done more for my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter of mans fall, you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient evidence of it; for, except the firſt and laſt Sections, all parts of it are a reſemblance of the depraved man (you ſpake of) ſufficiently corrupted: In the ſecond Section theſe are your words, <q>By this ſin they (that is our firſt parents) fell from their original righteouſneſs, and communion with God, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came dead in ſin, and wholly defiled in all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of ſoul and body.</q> In which words we finde the fruits of the forbidden tree, evil as well as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115397:51"/>good, error as well as truth. That they fell from their former communion with God, from ſome degree of original righteouſneſs, and that they became dead, that is liable to eternal death, we grant you: but that they fell wholly from original righteouſneſs, at the firſt Act of their Apoſtacy, or that they preſently became ſo wholly defiled as you ſpeak, are great miſtakes. As to the firſt of theſe, did not the Image of God in which they were created conſiſt in holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs? Now you know habits are not loſt by one act or two. Again, the thing that God threatned, was a gradual puniſhment as well as a certain; <hi>In dying, ye ſhall die.</hi> Furthermore, thoſe that fall away from incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated grace, and that renued Image of God (which is not at firſt ſo ſtrong and vigorous as Gods ſimilitude was in the firſt man) though they die, and being in a great decree of languiſhing are ſaid to be dead; yet they die but gradually &amp; after great debilities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, may be kept alive and recovered, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>I know thy works, that thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead. Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as for the ſecond, that they became wholly defiled in all parts and faculties, no Scripture ſpeaks it, nor could it be till the whole Image of God was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by contrary corruptions. True it is, that if the Lord had wholly left them to themſelves (as he did the rebellious and backſliding Angels) it would have fared no better with them in the end, then you ſpeak of: but the father of mercies was pleaſed to appear unto them in the cool and declination of the day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was dark night with them, and by his covenant of grace to help them up again.</p>
                  <p>In the third Section you ſay, <q>They being the root of all mankinde, the guilt of the ſin was imputed, and the ſame death in ſin and corrupted nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to all poſterity,</q> deſcending from them by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115397:51"/>generation; where that they were the root of all mankinde is undoubtedly true: but all the reſt of that Section may be juſtly queſtioned. And firſt, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage where you tacitely exempt Chriſt from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this ſin made unto him; for doubtleſs that, with all other ſins of ours, were laid upon him. But ſecondly, it may be upon good ground hoped, that it, neither was, nor ſhall be imputed to any of their poſterity, who are not the imitators of the ſame in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual rebellion; for that juſt Lord doth not onely forbid the puniſhing of the children for the iniquity of their parents, even with temporal death, <hi>Deut,</hi> 24.18. but he ſwears alſo by his own life, that he will not do that thing. <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.1—20. Then what you there affirm in the ſecond place is more improbable then the other; to wit; <q>That the ſame death in ſin and corrupt nature is conveyed to all their poſterity deſcending from them by ordinary generation, is yet more improbable.</q> For firſt, that ſome men are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified from the womb, as <hi>Jeremiah and John</hi> the Baptiſt were, and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> might poſſibly be, none will deny. And ſecondly, that all others are ſtill cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated innocent, in ſome meaſure of Gods image, there are not a few Scriptures which ſeem to teſtifie it; of which <hi>Geneſis</hi> the 9.6. is one, where the killing of men by a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivate hand is forbidden, becauſe in the image of God created he man; which reaſon will not hold unleſs man be ſtill ſo created: For if it were derived or drawn from the firſt created <hi>Adam,</hi> who by rebellion againſt God loſt that image, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with all his poſterity, it would rather lay a ground that man might now lawfully, or without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great ſcruple be killed (as a defaced, corrupt, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved creature) then that he ſhould be ſo tenderly ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and preſerved. For ſo <hi>Cain</hi> apprehended after he had ſinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. ſaying, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that every one who findeth me, ſhall ſlay me.</hi> But to clear the place unto all that ſeek the truth out of love unto
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115397:52"/>it; we affirm that this place muſt needs be ment of all mankinde, where he ſaith, for <hi>In the image of God made be man,</hi> becauſe the prepoſitive article &amp; particle <hi>Ha,</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before the noune, <hi>Adam,</hi> the name of him who is here ſaid to be killed, declaring it to be an appellative name of the whole ſpecies, and not the proper name of our firſt parent, yea, and he that is here ſaid to kill, hath here the ſame name of <hi>Haadam,</hi> as well as the perſon killed, given unto him: where it is ſaid, <hi>At the hands of man &amp; at the hands of every mans brother wil I require the life of men.</hi> It is therefore evident out of the context that the holy ghoſt ment it of mankinde in general, and not of the firſt created <hi>Adam,</hi> when he ſaith in the next verſe, for <hi>In the Image of God created he man;</hi> which thing may be yet farther evidenced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nextion, which all true Logicians obſerve betwixt the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and the Conſequent, which is this; <hi>Quia Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſic habet ſei deò Conſequens eſt,</hi>  For they depend as cauſe &amp; effect, the Antecedent here being the cauſe, and the Conſequent inſteed of the effect. The contextion is here confeſſed by all rational men in that act, <hi>ex vi cauſae exiſtere.</hi> Now to apply this to our purpoſe; if a man muſt not be killed, becauſe <hi>in the image of God he created man,</hi> then this reaſon which is the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent muſt be underſtood of man in general, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde univerſally, and of every <hi>individuum</hi> of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or elſe this Conſequent, that he ſhall have his blood ſhed, who ſheddeth mans blood <hi>verſe</hi> 6. can have no force of Argument from the ſaid Antecedent, <hi>viz,</hi> That <hi>in the image of God created be man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Scripture that is to be conſidered is that place <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4, 5. where we have two Arguments more to prove <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conſequently all men, to be ſtill created innocent. The firſt is from the perfection of all Gods works, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>He is the Rock, his work is perfect, for all his wayes are judgment: A God of truth; and without iniquity, juſt and right is he:</hi> How then can he which is holy, righteous, and pure, create any thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115397:52"/>that is unrighteous, unclean, or unpure? The ſecond is taken from Gods complaint there againſt mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal fall and corrupting themſelves, whom God had not brought forth with any ſuch ſpots, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>They have corrupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are a perverſe and crooked generation.</hi> A third Text aſſerting mans innocency, is the 8 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks thus of all mankind, <hi>What is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him? For thou baſt made him a litle lower then the Angels; and haſt crowned him with glory and honour:</hi> which glory lies in the Image of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. <hi>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is the image and glory of God:</hi> Thus the Pſalmiſt ſhews that the man is ſtill ſet in honour, to wit, by his firſt ſtate of production, though he doth not long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame, but falls therefrom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Nevertheleſs, man being in honour, abideth not: be is like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> So again <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Man that is in honour and underſtandeth not, is like the beaſt that periſh:</hi> But if man had been created ſo corrupt, as you ſpeak he had not onely been lower then the Angels, but below all creatures here. A fourth place evicting mans upright creation is, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. where the Preacher publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this truth to all the world, to vindicate Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in mans creation, and to ſhame the ſons of men for their vile Apoſtacy and degeneration; for <hi>This onely have I found, that God hath made man upright: but he hath ſought out many inventions,</hi> Where it is evident, firſt out of the context, and then out of the text, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of all mankinde in their ſucceeding generations. For firſt he ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 28. after his ſearch into man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. For ſuch as continued in innocency: <hi>One man</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>among a thouſand have I found, but a women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all thoſe have I not found.</hi> Secondly, in the text it ſelf, firſt, the word tranſlated man, is in the origional <hi>Haadam,</hi> the common name of mankinde. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when the wiſe man comes there to ſpeak of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115397:53"/>the fall, he aſcribes it not to our firſt fore-father alone but to the individuals of their poſterity, likewiſe ſaying, <hi>But they have ſought out many inventions,</hi> to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we might add this, that <hi>Solomon</hi> needed not to have uſherd in this fall &amp; depravement of mankinde with a <hi>Lo!</hi> or note of wonderment in the begining of this <hi>verſe,</hi> if all men (as you both hold and teach) came ſo corrupted into the world with the poyſon of propagated uncleanneſs. A fifth place that here ſtands up for the defence of this innocency, is that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22. which may be underſtood aſwel of a perſonal <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (each one of us being created for an holy City and habitation of God) as of the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> which were the preſent auditors and object of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> miniſtery: <hi>How is the faithful City become an harlot? It was full of judgement, righteouſneſs lodged therein, but now murtherers. Thy ſilver is become droſs, thy wine is mixed with water.</hi> Unto ſuch a perſonal <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as we deſcribed, ſpeaks the Prophet <hi>Jer. c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou maiſt be ſaved: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> A fifth place which like an undanted Advocate pleads for God ſtill creating men in uprightneſs, is that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. <hi>My beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful Hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the choiſeſt vine, and built a Tower in the midſt of it, and alſo made a wine-preſs therein: and he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and men of</hi> Judah, <hi>judge I pray you betwixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it ſhould have brought forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> Unto which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories the church, if they had believed your doctri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> might have anſwered thus: Thou mighteſt have done much more for thy vineyard then thou haſt done, if thou hadſt created us all in Gods Image, as thou didſt our firſt parents, a thing very eaſie unto thee: And how
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115397:53"/>wouldeſt thou, O wiſe and righteous Lord, expect that we ſhould bring forth any other fruit but wild grapes, ſince by our depravation derived from our firſt parents we are a meer wild vine. But as the choiſeſt vine with which God planteth his vineyard, is Chriſt from our creation planted in us, being called <hi>Ja.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The ingrafted word which is able to ſave our ſouls;</hi> ſo this vineyard is our heart or inward man, into which al are hired, or ſent by the Lord to work therein, &amp; to keep &amp; dreſs the ſame from the 3. unto the 11 hour, yet ſome at one hour and ſome at another are more excited to labour therein <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3,—16. And the wickedneſs which by our fall from God, we have brought in and planted, is the vine of <hi>Sodom</hi> (that is of their ſecret or foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) of which the Lord complains, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.32. <hi>For their vine is of the vine of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and the fields of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, <hi>their grapes are grapes of gall, their cluſters are bitter.</hi> A ſeventh place which lets his voyce be heard without fear, is that of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 2.21. where the Lord juſtifies himſelf, but juſtly blameth <hi>Iſrael. Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly of a right ſeed: How then are thou turned into the degenerate plant of a wild vine unto me?</hi> Now the whole nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was yet never thus planted any other way, but by an upright creation: for they were not all made ſuch by way of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any age or generation which was heretofore. Eighthly, when God by the ſame Prophet expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with them about their falling from him and not riſing again and returning, <hi>chapt.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. doth not the Lord implie that they once ſtood before they fell: yea, and that they had not yet loſt all abilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, when by precedent grace they where excited thereunto. <hi>Moreover, thou ſhall ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord, ſhall they fall and not ariſe? Shall he turn away, and not return? Wherefore is this people of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den back, by a perpetual back ſliding? They bold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return.</hi> Ninthly, the Lord in <hi>Hoſea chapter</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. laies <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſtruction upon her ſelf, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115397:54"/>not upon her firſt parents. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help:</hi> and ſo he doth their fall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>chapter</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael <hi>return unto the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, doth not our Saviour declare the ſtate of children both to be innocent and bleſſed, when firſt he makes it <hi>terminus, ad quem,</hi> unto which in our converſion and regeneration we muſt return, and then tels us that the kingdom of Heaven belongs unto ſuch, and is repleniſhed with ſuch, ſaying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And again Matth. 19.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. he ſaith, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> remove not onely from children malice, but all evil of iniquity, when he would have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in that behalf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. ſaying, <hi>Brethren be not children in underſtanding:</hi> Howbeit, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in malice or iniquity be children, but in underſtanding be perfect, or of a ripe age.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to omit many other Scriptures which might be produced upon this account, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that men are ſtill created after Gods Image, <hi>chap.</hi> 39. ſaying, <hi>Therewith</hi> (to wit, with the tongue) <hi>bleſs we God, even the Father, and therewith curſe we men, which are made after the ſimilitude of God.</hi> If it be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the Apoſtle here ment onely ſuch as were regenerate; we reply theſe three things. Firſt, that the verb here uſed ſignifies to create or make, but to create or make, but not to regenerate without ſome other exprſſion in the text ſo to limit it. Secondly that the Saints to whom St. <hi>James</hi> did now write, do not uſe to curſe each other. Thirdly, without doubt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle and Diſciple of Chriſt here reſtraining and reproving the curſing of men, would make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint as large as his maſter did, who would have us
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115397:54"/>to love all mankinde, even our enemies, and not curſe, any of them, but to bleſs and benefit them all herein following the example of our Hevenly Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44.45. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that diſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you, that ye may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your Father which is in Heaven: For he maketh his Son to riſe on the evil, and the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is all mankinde therefore that <hi>James</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from being curſed, and conſequently no leſs number that are made after Gods Image.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have proved, that neither the guilt of our firſt parents ſin was imputed, nor their ſpiritual death in ſin and corrupted nature was conveyed to all their poſterity, or to any one of them by ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, contrary to your aſſertions in your third Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>And though this your doctrine hath gone from hand to hand, a long time by tradition, yet neither did the Scribes and Phariſees, nor yet the Diſciples of Chriſt, and much leſs Chriſt himſelf hold forth any ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor were any of them leavened with this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of yours, and your long miſtaſten predeceſſors; for the Phariſees with the Jewes, being highly diſpleaſed with him who was born blind, and whoſe eyes Chriſt had opened for defending his Saviour and bleſſed Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiſt, ſaid thus unto him, <hi>John</hi> 9.34. <hi>Thou waſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther born in ſin, and doſt thou teach us?</hi> Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they did neither conceive all men in general, nor yet themſelves to be by propagation conceived and born in ſin. And when Chriſts Diſciples asked him ſaying, <hi>John</hi> 9.23. <hi>Maſter who did ſin, this man or his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that he was born blinde? Jeſus anſwered, neither hath this man ſinned nor his parents: but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> Where according to your doctrine our Saviour ſhould have anſwered poſitively; that both he and his parents with all his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115397:55"/>progenitors, even as far as <hi>Adam,</hi> had ſinned, and were all, as many deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary generation from one generation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity. But our Saviour taught no ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor did his Apoſtles (when rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) hold forth any thing that tends this way more then the Prophets their Predeceſſors, or the Prince of the Prophets, their Maſter did; in which point all are ſilent, if not cleerly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto you: The Lord commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Cities of fefuge ſhould be ſet apart in all the coaſts and habitations of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to flee to, as had ſlain any man at unawares, that the avenger of blood ſhould not ſlay the innocent with a temporal death, <hi>Deu.</hi> 19. &amp;c. And will the Lord purſue the innocent ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> and hold them guilty for their Fathers ſin perpetrated ere they were born? yea, will he himſelf be the avenger of the blood againſt theſe innocents; <hi>Amaziah</hi> is commended for his juſtice (and his obedience in that behalf, to the Law of the Lord) in not ſlaying the ſons of thoſe that murderd his father <hi>Joaſh,</hi> but only the fathers that did the Villany, 2 <hi>Ki.</hi> 14.5, 6. And wil ye Brethren father upon God the fountain of all juſtice, and the Father of mercies, a cruelty forbiden in his own Law, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 24.16. who was ſo far from deſtroying the infants of <hi>Nineveh</hi> (though but an handful compared to the vaſt harveſt of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity) that he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole Cities, mainly, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, next after the peoples repentance, as he

For firſt, God doth put truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Saints and Angels, whom he dayly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth. Secondly, The heavens and all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they come out of the Creators hands, are pure and good in his ſight. And thirdly, though ſome men are ſo accuſtomed to ſin, that they have contracted an hypodropical chirſt thereunto, yet neither <hi>Job</hi> of whom he means all this in hypotheſie, nor any other of the Saints upon earth do drink iniquity like water: But ſuppoſe all men did ſo, yet it doth not from hence follow that we are all ſo deeply tainted, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſin drawn from <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt parent: For as he corrupted himſelf by his perſonal Lapſe &amp; diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo may any other man, and ſo doubtleſs do all lapſed men do likewiſe.

Secondly for the clearing of the truth, let us firſt conſider, whether <hi>David</hi> had no other parents but <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and his wife, and then if he had which is the mother that he here ſpeak of. As to the firſt, beſides our natural parents we have ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, whether for our begetting in the evil and iniquity, or for our regeneration in grace and goodneſs.

Which thing the

                  <p>Firſt, Some ſinned like <hi>Adam,</hi> not in <hi>Adam;</hi> others ſinned, not after the ſimilitude of his tranſgreſſion, but ſome other way, as after <hi>Eſau</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 18.16, 17. or the like, according to that, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Apoſtle had beleeved any ſuch thing, as the raigning of death over all men by the firſt mans ſin, he would not have omitted that, and onely mentioned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> for all may perceive his main deſigne is from verſe 12. to the 15. to ſet forth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and extent of deaths reigning over ſinners therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115397:60"/>he would have uſed the fulleſt and plaineſt expreſſion ſerving to that purpoſe: but the 19. verſe is more plain againſt univerſal corruption by the firſt mans diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for there the Apoſtle uſeth the word <hi>many,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>by one mans diſobediene many</hi> (not all) <hi>were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Therefore all fell not in the firſt individual <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any yet reply, <hi>That (many) in that place is</hi> tant' a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount <hi>and equivalent to the word (all)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We Anſwer, That then by the ſame reaſon, the word (many) in the latter part of the verſe muſt have the ſame latitude allowed, for the Apoſtle ſetteth down a full compariſon of equals in that verſe: here the verſe muſt be thus interpreted, <hi>That as by one mans diſobedience, all were made ſinners: ſo by one mans obedience, all are made righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any yet reply, and ſay, <hi>By one mans obedience all that repent and beleeve are made righteous: then by the ſame inter retation, By ones mans diſobedience all are made ſinners; that imitate him, and ſin like him, after the ſimilitude of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam<hi>'s tranſgreſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus all men may ſee, there is nothing gained by interpreting the word (many) (by a Synecdoche) for (all) are made ſinners by one mans diſobedience; for the latter part of the verſe muſt have the word (many) ſo explained: which to affirm, namely, that (all) are righteous by Chriſt, by an abſolute and uniuerſal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is accounted as deteſtable an Hereſy, as it hath been hitherto, to deny that all and every one to be ſinners by the firſt individual mans diſobedience: but grant that the word (many) in both parts of this 19. verſe muſt be explained by the word (all) how clear then without any darkneſs is the meaning, when it is ſaid, <hi>by one mans diſobedience,</hi> namely, <hi>the natural</hi> Adam<hi>'s diſobedience all are made ſinners,</hi> becauſe all that ever ſin, ſin in that natural <hi>Adam;</hi> for <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>he that is born of God ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>neth not, neither can he ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> Hence by the obedience of one, that is, the heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> (many) that is (all) are made
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115397:60"/>righteous according to that, <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.48. <hi>As is the earthy, ſo are they that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, ſo are they that are heavenly;</hi> and therefore as we have borne the Image of the earthy, by our diſobedience, ſo let us ſeek to bear the Image of the heavenly; <hi>That</hi> (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 19.) <hi>by one mans diſobedience we all may be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we hope it plainly appears that no place in the fifth of the <hi>Romans</hi> aſſerteth the imputation of the firſt mans ſin to all poſterity, though it do affirm <hi>that by one man ſin entered into the world:</hi> which muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the one natural man, or common <hi>Adam,</hi> in, and upon us all according to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>For, as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> That is, as all die in the earthy <hi>Adam</hi> (that do die) ſo all that live, are made alive in Chriſt the Heavenly <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We come now to anſwer the arguments brought <hi>à ſimili,</hi> whereby you deceive your ſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, It is uſually ſaid, <hi>That Traytors are not onely puniſhed themſelves for their Treaſon, but their poſterity alſo have their blood tainted, and deprived of their inheritance.</hi> But we demand by what Law? Is this by Gods Law and Command, that the poſterity of a Traytor ſhould be ſo tainted and deprived, or by mans law, without warrant from Gods Law? If ſo, That doth not argue God will deal with <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity to taint them for his ſin, and deprive them of an inheritance immortal (which the Lord giveth, and not man) for the firſt mans ſin.</p>
                  <p>But to apply our ſelves to your <hi>ſimile:</hi> We anſwer, That none but the fathers are puniſhed with death for that ſin; their children are onely diſinherited of the lands and honours which are hereditary, but are not made uncapable of new: and though all this be done <hi>In terrorem,</hi> yet it leaves Traytors life and being with manyfold capacities of well being; but you leave a great part of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity (for his ſin by you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115397:61"/>to them) no hope of ſalvation; yea, you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to eternal deſtruction for that ſame they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſented unto, nor could avoid.</p>
                  <p>Another Objection <hi>à ſimili,</hi> is this: <hi>That as the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of</hi> Achan (Joſua 7.24.) <hi>periſhed with him for his ſin, ſo may we juſtly periſh with the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>for his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer, Firſt, <hi>Achan</hi>'s ſons being acquainted with the hidden Treaſure, and approving the theſt (as it is probable they might) were involved in the fin, and worthy to be partaker of the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was but a temporal death which his ſons ſuffered, and not an eternal deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is objected, <hi>That as young Vipers or Serpents are killed with the old ones: (becauſe we know they have the poyſonous nature in them) So may</hi> Adams <hi>poſterity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer, That the ſimilitude cannot hold; for (as we have proved already) <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated innocent, yea, righteous ſtill even in the nautral man, beſides a ſpiritual <hi>Adam</hi> that lieth hidden in all men.</p>
                  <p>True it is, That by a voluntary fall, and the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of manifold rebellions, many men (as <hi>John</hi> calleth them <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>make themſelves a generation of vipers:</hi> but they are not ſo born, by their deſcent from the firſt finful <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we need not throw dirt in the face of our firſt parents, nor transfer the guilt of our fall to thoſe which lived almoſt ſix thouſand years before us, if we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood what we our ſelves have done; yea, if we underſtand that one man (before ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. to the end of the chapter) to be oppoſed unto, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled with Chriſt in a contrary way or courſe: then we may conceive, that one man as properly, if not more truely, to be meant of one perſonal, yet common <hi>Adam,</hi> as of our firſt progenitors, to defame him: which will be more fully declared when we ſpeak of Chriſt the other member of the collation or parallel
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115397:61"/>in the 5. chapter, that is concerning Chriſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</p>
                  <p>We beſeech you to pardon this our long aboad upon your third Section, becauſe we know by experience our oppoſing the tradition of original ſin in children, will be moſt ſtumbled at and wondered at by them that never ſurveyed the Scriptures about it.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section you proceed and ſay, <q>From this original corruption whereby we are utterly indiſpoſed, diſabled and made oppoſite to all good, and wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to all evil,</q> do proceed all actual tranſgreſſions. Where to your former error of deriving both the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the corruption of nature to his poſterity, you add three more according to the multiplying nature of error.</p>
                  <p>But firſt you will not deny that <hi>Adam</hi> was in the eſtate of regeneration before he begat any of his children; and what true reaſon can there be given why grace and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Image of God being inherent and connatural, ſhould not be derived to his ſeed, as well as his corruptions which were not either univerſal, or perfect in degree, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he by grace was renewed again, as we have already proved; but of that enough before.</p>
                  <p>II. How do you prove that the firſt fall which we call original ſin, whether happening in <hi>Adam</hi> or our ſelves, doth preſently render us both unable, yea, and altogether indiſpoſed and oppoſite to any good? For the whole Image of God is not blotted out at once: Doth not the Lord teſtifie of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> ſon-who was ſick, <hi>That there was ſome good thing left in him towards the Lord;</hi> and therefore he is taken away before that thoſe laſt ſparkes be extinguiſhed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.13.</p>
                  <p>III. As the Image of God is defaced gradually, ſo corruption is contracted by degrees, ſo that all men are not corrupted in every part, nor alike deeply corrupted: ſo <hi>Judah</hi> by continuance in ſin, in proceſs of time, had more polluted her ſelf <hi>then Samaria her elder ſiſter, or Sodom her pounger, Ezek.</hi> 16, 45, 46, 47. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt age of the old world upon which the deluge was ſent, was more corrupt then any that went before it, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115397:62"/>thereupon it was deſtroyed. Therefore that which the Lord ſpeaks, in complaint of that age is not equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all ages, and muchleſs to all perſons; Although that is true of all grown men which the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>That the imaginations of mans hears are evil from his youth,</hi> that is, from the firſt times of his fal, for ſo they then begin to be.</p>
                  <p>True it is that the great wickedneſs, which the Pſalmiſt complains of in his enemies, and the perſecutors of Gods people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14 1, 2. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo that which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> confeſſeth to God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 59.2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be ſound in too many, and that not alone in thoſe that are meer ſtrangers unto God, but in many members of the viſible Church, and therefore the Apoſtle applies thoſe ſayings to the Jews, to prove them guilty of ſin and death, as well as the Gentiles <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, 10—But though it muſt of neceſſity be granted (which the Apoſtle affirms there after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23) <hi>That all both Jews and Gentiles ſince the fall have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> Yet it will not follow from hence that all are alike deeply corrupted as they imply; And this is your ſecond miſtake in this Section.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas you ſay in the cloſe of this Section, <q>That all actual tranſgreſſions do proceed from this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal corruption,</q> of which you here ſpeak; It is falſe undoubtedly. For Satan tempts men to many ſins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have no previous inclination, and ſuggeſts unto ſome of Gods ſervants ſuch blaſphemies as they abhor: ſo far are they from being natural or familiar to them: cannot that ſubtile powerful adverſaries now tempt men aſwel without corrupt inclinations, as he did our firſt parents in their innocency?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to take a view of your fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h Section: you do not only affirm groſs untruths there, but ſeem to contradict your ſelves alſo.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, <q>That this corruption of nature doth remain in the regenerate during this life;</q> of which afterwards. And then you adde, <q>Though it be in Chriſt both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and mortified— What do you ſay brethren?</q> Is it mortified by Chriſt, and yet doth it remain?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is it pardoned and yet doth it abide ſtill in us?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115397:62"/>For the firſt of theſe, muſt it remain in us all our life time? when then muſt it be quite purged out? Muſt it be done in Purgatory hereafter? or muſt men carry the remainders of ſin with them into Gods Kingdom, whereinto no unclean thing can enter? <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. Surely you did not foreſee what a world of abſurdities would follow hereupon. Muſt we not be implanted into the ſimilitude of Chriſts death (his total death) that we may be implanted into the likeneſs of his reſurrection? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. Certainly as the pattern was not a bare wounding or an half death in Chriſt, ſo muſt our mortification be no leſs then a full death likewiſe. Can Chriſt alſo be fruſtrate of the end of his coming? who gave himſelf for his Church that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinckle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25, 26, 27. Since this waſhing (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) muſt be by the water of the word, ſurely it muſt be effected in this life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is corruption a thing ſo well pleaſing to God and his Chirſt that he will not depart with it or wholly loſe the preſence and ſociety of it? See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. <hi>For what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and what communion hath light with darkneſs, and what concord hath Chriſt with</hi> Belial? <hi>and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not ſin and corruption an enemy to Chriſt as well as death? Now the Apoſtle faith, <hi>That the laſt enemy which ſhall be deſtroyed is death.</hi> If death then be the laſt enemy, then of neceſſity ſin muſt be deſtroyed before. But ſince you are wont to object many things againſt this: Let us take a view of your objections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you ſay, <q>That as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were left to prove the faith and obedience of the Iſraelites,</q> 
                     <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.1. ſo the Lord in the beginning of our regeneration, leaves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruptions to exerciſe our faith, love, and obedience likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is true, that they are left at the firſt for that end: But would the Lord have them alwayes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in us? On no: For as the Lord was diſpleaſed with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115397:63"/>his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> for permitting thoſe Nations ſtill to dwel among them when they ſhould have ſubdued them or caſt them out, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.1, 2. ſo will the Lord be highly offended with us if we roote not out theſe wicked Nations through the help of his Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. It is certain that <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart, ſubdued all the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites;</hi> ſo that when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſucceeded him, there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemy left, nor evil occurrent, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.4. And ſo hath Chriſt the promiſe that <hi>all his enemies ſhall be his fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole,</hi> Pſal. 110.1. Acts 2: 34. Yea he is given to us for our final deliverance from them and conqueſt over them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.71. John 3.8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſay, "That corruption is leſt to keep us humble leaſt we grow proud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If all corruption were purged out, what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of pride? Are not the Angels and Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moſt humble?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you alledg that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes, 1 <hi>King,</hi> 1.48. <hi>'s For there is no man that ſinneth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> peradventure it may be granted that there is no man that ordinarily lived to mans eſtate who hath not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſinned (Chriſt excepted) Howbeit it doth not follow from hence that the regenerate ſhall always do ſo; for St. <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>writes to the Saints not to ſin;</hi> ſee alſo <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You are wont to urge that place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>who</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>can ſay, I have made my heart clean?</hi>
                     </q> I am pure from my ſin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, that kind of interrogation doth not always imply a nullity, but ſometimes a paucity onely, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>who hath beleeved our report?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, No man can ſay, that he hath done this by his own ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Some alſo object that place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. <hi>the righteous falleth ſeven times, and riſeth again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The words following ſhew that this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of affliction, not of ſin, which words are theſe; <hi>But the wicked fall into miſchief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That place, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. is much inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>For there is not a juſt man in the earth which doth good, and ſinneth not;</hi> which place may be three wayes anſwered, and yet the ſaying hold true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:115397:63"/>Firſt, That though there were no ſuch man in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, being the infancy of the Church, yet after-times might bring forth many ſuch, when a fuller diſpenſation of grace ſhould come, <hi>James</hi> 4.6. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.40. <hi>God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided ſome better things for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not improbable that there hath been no man in any age (Chriſt excepted) who hath not ſinned, or done that which is good continually, as we ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is an Earth of ſin and corruption, in which there is no man but ſinneth often, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie therefore your members which are upon earth, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But a ſecond, and a grand objection is made out of Rom. 7.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>&amp;c. For the Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is ſpiritual, But I am carnal, ſold under ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Although this place is commonly taken, as if the Apoſtle ſpoke here of his own perſonal and preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, yet it is certain he did not; firſt, becauſe elſewhere (ſpeaking of that eſtate) he contradicts what is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>For I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> but here the perſon ſpoken of knowes much evil by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me;</hi> but he that is here intended, though to will is preſent with him, yet findes no means or power to do any good: yea, that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115397:64"/>preſent eſtate, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, verſe</hi> 2. is directly oppoſite to what is complained of <hi>verſe</hi> 23, of this 7 <hi>chapter;</hi> for in that 23. <hi>verſe</hi> the complaint ſpeaketh thus; <hi>But I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my minde, and bringing me into coptivity to the law of ſin which is in my members; Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> But Rom. 8.2. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death:</hi> what can be more contradictory then this laſt place is to the former? So that of neceſſity the fiſt place muſt be underſtood of babes in Chriſt, whom <hi>Paul</hi> here perſonates, inſtructs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and the latter of his own preſent condition, and victorie, as <hi>Occumenius</hi> and others well obſerve: and what was more uſual with the Apoſtle, then to ſpeak of that which concerns others in his own perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>And theſe things brethren I have in a figure transferred to my ſelf, and</hi> Apollos <hi>for your ſake,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.11, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>Thirdly, You alledge againſt us and this truth, the words which the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 5. verſe 17. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; and theſe are contrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y the one to the other; ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would:</hi> Here ſay you, the Apoſtle deſcribes that combat betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, which muſt continue while we endure in the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But where do you read that this conflict muſt laſt ſo long? The Apoſtle ſaith a good ſpace before his death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 47. <hi>I have fought a good fight; I have finiſhed my courſe; I have kept the faith.</hi> Were not the Galatians <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> ſo young and weak, that the Apoſtle had no ſooner left them, then they were ready to be drawn away from Chriſt by the falſe Apoſtles? See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. with 3.1, 2. Now to make their eſtate the higheſt pitch &amp; growth of a Chriſtian in this life is, as if we ſhould take the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a child, and conclude that it is the full ſtature of mankinde, and that no man is or can be of a taller groth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You object what St. <hi>James</hi> writes, chap. 3.2.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115397:64"/>
                     <hi>For in many things we offend all,</hi> where you imvolue him and his fellow Apoſtles in that plural number.</p>
                  <p>To which we anſwer, That the Apoſtle can no more be there implyed, then in the 9 verſe, where he ſaith again, and that plurally, <hi>With the ſame tongue we bleſs God, even the Father;</hi> and, <hi>with the ſame tongue we curſe men, which are made after the ſimilitude of God:</hi> Was <hi>James,</hi> or the Apoſtles now of the number of thoſe that ſtill curſed men? But it is frequent for lenity ſake, and in a winning way, for the Prophets and Apoſtles of Chriſt to ſpeak in the plural, and ſometimes in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number thoſe things which concern not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but their hearers onely, <hi>Nebem.</hi> 5.10. <hi>I pray you let us leave of this uſury,</hi> ſaith the man of God, who was no wayes guilty of that ſin; <hi>Iſa</hi> 59.10. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh this, <hi>We groap for the wall like the blind, and we groap as if we had no eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is objected out of 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. That the Apoſtle ſaith directly, <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and there is no truth in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The ſame Apoſtle implyes <hi>ch.</hi> 4 17. that he and his fellow Apoſtles were now without ſin; <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we might have boldneſs in the day of Judgement;</hi> becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world: There is no fear in love, <hi>but perſect love caſteth out fear.</hi> The Apoſtle therefore ſpeaks the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words to thoſe that were young in Chriſt, and yet imperfect, as is evident, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you that ye ſin not,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf ſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 10. that he may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken into the number; <hi>If we that ſay we have not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we make him a lyar, and his word is not in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much of your firſt erroneous propoſition in your 5th and laſt Section: Your other Theſis (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you affirm, <q>That though this corruption remains in the regenerate during life, yet it is actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned) is falſe alſo,</q> and contradictory to theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and many other Scriptures; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115397:65"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. or, as we ſhall ſhall ſhew at large <hi>chap.</hi> 11. by Gods aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Now for a concluſion of this laſt Section, give us leave to propound theſe Queries unto you; Firſt, whether thoſe ten unbeleeving ſpies, did not highly diſpleaſe God, and much hinder, injure and prejudice the people which hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened unto them, who cryed, <hi>that there were ſuch Anaki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E will not ſay that you have made a Covenant with death, or an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with hell; but in this tract of the Covenant you do not alwayes keep league with truth; for though you beging plauſibly in the firſt Section, yet both there and elſwhere you affirm many things untruly.</p>
                  <p>As firſt when you ſay, <hi>That the diſtance between God and the creature is ſo great, that though all reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they never could have any fruition of him as their bleſſedneſs and reward but by ſome voluntary condeſcenſion on Gods part which he hath been pleaſed to expreſs by way of Covenant.</hi> For do not the elect Angels from their firſt creation by their firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſee God in his own light, and participate of his bleſſedneſs in wiſdom, holineſs, power, life, peace, and glory? And if the Lord did not create our firſt parents in ſo ful a fruition of bleſſedneſs; yet he could have ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified them if he had pleaſed without a precedent cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: And was not the humanity of Chriſt in his inward man, placed in that communion and fruition of God, from the beginning of his incarnation, though his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man was ſubject to mortality and miſery?</p>
                  <p>Yet you make us ſome peece of amends in your ſecond ſection, ſaying, <hi>That the Lord made a Covenant of works with mankinde at the firſt, wherein li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e was promiſed to</hi> Adam, <hi>and in him to his poſterity upon condition of perſonal
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115397:67"/>and perfect obedience,</hi> Where by the way you tacitly grant two truths by your ſelves denyed, and by us aſſerted Chapter the third; ſo powerful is truth in it ſelf, that oft times it breaks forth from men <hi>de improviſo</hi> though they have gain ſaid it before, the which two truths are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt that all men in <hi>Adam</hi> were appointed or ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life if the Covenant of life was made to him and all his poſterity. For God works all things in time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eternal counſel of his will, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, That this decree was conditional alſo; for ſo you confeſs the firſt Covenant to have been, and ſo are all ſubſequent Covenants likewiſe or the far greateſt part of them, which are given by God himſelf to mankinde.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you are more defective and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; for though you ſay truly in the beginning of it, <hi>That man by his fall having made himſelf uncapable of life by the Covenant of works, the Lord was pleaſed to make a ſecond Covenant commonly called the Covenant of grace wherein be freely offereth unto ſinners life and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Yet herein you faile in that you do not ſet forth that this Covenant was univerſal for all ſinners as indeed it was. For it was made with all mankinde in our firſt parents, and as all that fell had need of the ſame, and were by creation alike related to God; ſo he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon all impartially, being no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and appointed one mediator, alike neer to all men, betwixt him and us, even the man Chriſt as we ſhewed before out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24, &amp;c. <hi>Rom</hi> 10.11, 12, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, you are here deficient in ſetting forth Gods ſtipulation in this Covenant: for you ſay, <hi>That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires faith in Chriſt that men may be ſaved:</hi> but the Lord inſiſts not onely upon faith, but upon obedience alſo to all his commands, yea obedience unto the death, to

Thus of your defects here; but whereas you ſay in the cloſe of that Section, <hi>That God promiſeth to give unto all thoſe that are ordained unto life his holy Spirit to make them willing and able to believe,</hi> it is not true; we would gladly have you produce anyone ſuch promiſe; yet dowe grant that the Lord is pleaſed to enlighten and teach all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are out of the way, and capable of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the way to life again; ſo that they may believe, repent and turn if they will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Good and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is the Lord, therefore will he teach ſinners in the way.</hi> The text to which you refer us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the latter dayes, and that of ſuch a clenſing from ſin, as you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or admit, but not of faith: though the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation there promiſed, implyeth a precedent faith, and therein both illumination on Gods part and aſſent, or credence to the truth revealed on ours.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth Section you ſay: <q>That this Covenant of grace is frequently ſet forth in Scripture by the name of a Teſtament;</q> and ſo is the Covenant upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> likewiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. for thoſe ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>are the two Teſtaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſecondly whereas you add, <q>That this name is given to that Covenant onely in reference to the death of Chriſt the Teſtator, and to the everlaſting inheritance with all things belonging unto it therein bequeathed;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You herein fall ſhort again; for the believer, who is the other party to the Covenant, muſt in following of Chriſt dye with him; and there muſt follow the death of this Teſtator likewiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. <hi>For if we be dead with him, we believe that we ſhall live with him,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>For if we live after the fleſh, we ſhall dye; but if we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115397:68"/>the deeds of the body by the ſpirit, we ſhall live,</hi> So 2 Tim. 2.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>In your fifth Section you are defective likewiſe in two things and miſtaken in a third.</p>
                  <p>For firſt whereas you ſay, <q>That this Covenant was differently adminiſtred in the time of the Law and of the Goſpel,</q> your ſaying is true, but much too ſhort to expreſs the various adminiſtrations of the Covenant, for it was adminiſtred after one manner before the Law, after another under the Law, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a third under the prophets: and all this before the time of the Goſpel, before the Law as it was at the firſt made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed with <hi>Noah,</hi> but more ſolemnly reinſtituted with <hi>Abraham</hi> for the bleſſing of all Nations and generations of mankinde: ſo all this time it was adminiſtred without outward ceremonies and ſervices, more then commemorative ſacrifices of Chriſts inward ſufferings, <hi>That Lambe ſlain from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, Rev.</hi> 13.8. which yet were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive likewiſe to a dying with Chriſt unto all ſin and wickedneſs: but under the Law, as you truly ſpeak, it was adminiſtered by promiſes, prophecies, the Paſchal Lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of Iſrael in general, and not to the Jews alone, as you ſet forth: And it was partly ſet forth as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, if not to mind us of original innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, yet to be our Schoolemaſter to Chriſt, ſhewing us our inability in our ſelves to keep the law with our ſins and miſeries, and what manifold need we had of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. and partly as a Covenant of grace alſo; finally under the prophets it was diſpenſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by promiſes and predictions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.34, 35, 36. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.38.39. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.18, 19, &amp; 36 25, 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as you were defective in ſaying, <q>That thoſe types, ſacrifices and ſervices under the Law did onely figure out Chriſt to come;</q> whereas they did teach the Iſraelites, the whole way to life alſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115397:68"/>in following of Chriſt: ſo you are in ſaying, that the Covenant of grace in regard of the former diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is called the old Teſtament, as you do alſo in ſaying, <q>That in the Goſpel, it being under other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations is called the new Teſtament in the ſixth Section.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For according to the Scripture, and the minde of God the Old and New Teſtament are thus to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed? The whole word of grace, whether ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by Prophets or Apoſtles, is the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is a foregoing Teſtament adminiſtred by true Elders; but the work of grace in purging out ſin, renewing us in righteouſneſs, writing the Law of God in our hearts, and ſealing the everlaſting forgiveneſs of ſins unto us, is the new Teſtament. So that the Old Teſtament is the Covenant which we ſhould obſerve and keep, or endeavor ſo to do: but the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the work of grace which God hath promiſed in and through Chriſt; Thus Chriſt is called <hi>the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new Teſtament, Heb.</hi> 9.15. and his ſpirit blood, <hi>the blood of the new Teſtament,</hi> Mat. 26.28. Yet we do not deny but that both the Prophets and Apoſtles were able Miniſters of the new Teſtament, as true publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of this promiſed grace, and not of the letter onely as were the Scribes and Phariſees, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3.6. Not that the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets comparatively to the writings of the Apoſtles are or ſhould be called the old Teſtament, as they ſeem to be termed 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.12. for this we ſay, that the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles may be ſo called likewiſe, and are no other in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the promiſed work of cleanſing and renewing grace, which God alone both can and muſt effect: Howbeit we do not condemn the common diſtinction and diſtribution of the books written before and ſince Chriſts incarnation by the penmen of the Holy Ghoſt, into thoſe of the old Teſtament or inſtrument, and the other of the new, becauſe they ſet forth the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more plainly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:115397:69"/>In you ſixth and laſt Section, beſides the miſtake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touched, we crave leave to rectifie you in theſe enſuing things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, whereas you ſay, <q>That now in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Chriſt the ſubſtance is exhibited;</q> If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the incarnation of Chriſt is the ſubſtance of all that was foreſhewed, required or promiſed in the times of the Law and the Prophets, it is a great miſtake; for not onely his ſufferings and reſurrection, but our conformity in following him, with the whole proceſs and work of ſalvation was thereby ſet out manifold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly under the Adminiſtrations of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>Secondly whereas you ſay, <q>That now under the Goſpel the ordinances (under which the Covenant of Grace is or ought to be diſpenced) are the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word,</q> and the adminiſtration of baptiſm, and the Lords Supper; we grant it to be true, if thoſe be adminiſtred by ſuch perſons to whom Chriſt is truely come in his light, ſpirit, and power. Otherwiſe for men to preach a ſelf-conceived Chriſt, whom they have learned by reading or tradition from their blinde guides, or to adminiſter the Sacraments without any due underſtanding of the Baptiſm, fleſh and blood of Chriſts; theſe are not Gods ordinances, but mens u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly we grant you, that where the Covenant of grace is ſet forth by men, ſo taught and acted by the Spirit of Chriſt, as we have deſcribed, there it is held forth in more evidence, ſpiritual efficacy and fulneſs, then it was in <hi>Moſes</hi> his literal ſervices But this will not be equally verified of thoſe that preach a miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt, without true light or life.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly whereas you conclude, <q>That there are not then two Covenants of grace, one under the old Teſtament,</q> and another under the new; we will from this your confeſſion inferr, that the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace made was unto, and for all mankinde
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115397:69"/>becauſe the Goſpel by Chriſts expreſs command is to be preached to every humane creature, and hath univerſal, but conditional ſalvation annexed unto it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19 <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. What then will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your doctrine of Gods preterition, of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular redemption of ſome men onely, of the effectual calling of this and that elected one onely and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points wherein with <hi>Herod</hi> you impriſon <hi>John,</hi> that is, you confine the grace and mercy of God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the foundation of the ſecond Temple was laid, as the younger ſort ſhouted for joy, ſo thoſe that had ſeen the former houſe wept. And though ſome younglings in the faith may rejoyce at this groundwork which you have laid, yet were there any ſuch here, who had ſeen the houſe of God built in the Apoſtles dayes, they could not refrain from teares, beholding your ungrounded ground-work.</p>
                  <p>True it is which the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11, 13, <hi>&amp;c. That other foundation can no man lay then that which is already laid by them, even Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> But as all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials are not apt for building: ſo both matter and workmanſhip bewray the workmans skil, or unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And truly, you brethren diſcover ſufficiently what manner of builders you are, who upon the foundation Jeſus Chriſt have built ſo much wood, hay and ſtuble, but ſo little of gold, ſilver, or precious ſtones. But ſince the word of God is compared to a fire, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.23. Let us try what ſtuffe of yours will abide the fire, that you may receive a reward, and what muſt of neceſſity burn, that though you ſuffer loſs therein, your ſouls may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>In your firſt Section then beſides many omiſſions concerning Chriſt, as that he is the wiſdom and power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>The brightneſs of his glory, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs image of his perſon, the creator, and upholder of all things, who purgeth our ſins by himſelf. Heb.</hi> 1.2. You ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115397:72"/>of the Father, and him ignorantly, prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and untruly alſo.</p>
                  <p>For firſt you ſay. <q>That the father hath given him a people from all eternity;</q> which being underſtood of an actual gift is falſe, for then there was no people to be beſtowed upon him.</p>
                  <p>If you here meant that this was done by deſign and decree only, why did you not ſo expreſs your ſelves? True it is by the confeſſion of Chriſt himſelf, that there are ſome which are given unto him by the father, which alſo come unto him, at leaſt wiſe for a time <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. But theſe are they who are taught by the Father firſt, and actually brought to know Chriſt and beleeve on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39.40, 44, 45, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 17.11, 12. Thus was <hi>Judas</hi> alſo given unto him <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you ſay, <q>That theſe are given to him, firſt to be redeemed, then called, thirdly juſtified, fourthly ſanctified, and laſtly glorified by him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where firſt you may take notice of your prepoſterous diſorder, for all that are given or brought to Chriſt, are a people firſt called by God the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. And though Chriſt invites them to come unto him for releaſe from their ſpiritual burdens, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.28, 29. Yet untill the father hath called them they cannot be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch burdens.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas you ſay that he ſhould firſt redeem againſt the Apoſtles order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. then juſtifie, after ſanctifie, and laſtly glorifie them, you may pleaſe to take notice in the ſequel of this book, that inward or ſpiritual redemption in the Apoſtles ſenſe is al one with juſtification, &amp; that juſtification &amp; ſanctification differ not. And as for outward redemption, the benefit of it accrues to no man, till he be firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anctified, and hath put away his ſins, that they may be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you here name but one ſort of people who are to be ſaved by Chriſt; to wit, thoſe which are faln in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In your ſecond Section, you make ſo clear a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſts two natures united into one perſon, of his conception by the Holy Ghoſt, of his birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in the fulneſs of time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate you from the errours of many hereticks which heretofore troubled the Church.

If there be ſuch an union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, why have you made no mention of the one, nor of the other. As for the former of theſe, we have ſhewed already in part that Chriſt is in every man by creation, which may be further cleared by theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>John</hi> 1.20, 26, 27, 28. <hi>John</hi> anſwered them, ſaying, <hi>I baptiſe with water,</hi>

                  <p>In your 3 Section you are firſt much miſtaken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards no leſs defective. Miſtaken in theſe things. 1. That you ſay, <q>That the Lord Jeſus in his human nature was ſanctified above meaſure.</q> For though it is ſaid of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. <hi>that he receiveth not the ſpirit by meaſure;</hi> yet that is ſpoken of the God-head, which alone is infinite. As for his humanity, it being a creature, muſt needs be finite, though ſpiritually enriched above any other creature. 2. Whereas you ſay, or imply, <q>That in his humanity likewiſe all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom are hidden, it is a miſtake likewiſe.</q> "For that place, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. to which you refer us ſpeaks of the Diety likewiſe. The ſame we ſay concerning, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.19. where it is written, <hi>that it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> by you appropriated, but amiſs, to his human nature. 2. Though it muſt be granted alſo to be true, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſte ſpeakes <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 26. <hi>that he is holy, hormleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the Heavens;</hi> yet the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115397:73"/>laſt words transfer this honor to the Deity eſpecially, and not to the humanity alone, as you would reſtrain them. And thus he is throughly furniſhed to do the great office of a Mediator; which Office, as you truely ſay, <q>Chriſt did not take upon himſelf, of his own head, but was there unto called of his Father,</q> who hath put all power &amp; judgement into his hand. Thus of your miſtakes; deficient you are in ſetting forth what and wherein the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt doth mainly conſiſt, eſpecially in his works of ſpiritual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, Interceſſion, and Redemption.</p>
                  <p>In your 4. Section you have in part ſet forth Chriſts two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſtate in the humanity, the one of humiliation, &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of exaltation; but if you will confider what you have here omitted, you will have more cauſe to be humbled then exalted. For 1. You make no mention at all, of that great work of his, wherein Gods juſtice and ſeverity againſt ſin is ſo conſpicuous, and the love of Chriſt towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is ſo illuſtrious, to wit, Chriſts deſcending into Hel, &amp; his ſuffering there for us the torments due to the ſins of the whole world. Which grand article of the Faith, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the moſt ancient Creeds &amp; confeſſed in the moſt Orthodox Councels, is by you ſuppreſſed to the eternal ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh of this your confeſſion. But Conſider we pray you, was not <hi>Jonah</hi> three daies afflicted or tormented by the ſenſe of Gods wrath upon him in the belly of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as a type of our Saviours future ſufferings? See <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.2. <hi>Out of the belly of Hell have I cried unto thee,</hi> compared with Mat. 12.40. <hi>For as</hi> Jonah <hi>was</hi> 3 <hi>daies and</hi> 3 <hi>nights in the Whales belly; ſo ſhall the Son of man be</hi> 3 <hi>daies and</hi> 3 <hi>nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle alſo expreſly ſay, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 9. <hi>Now that be aſcended, what is it but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the earth?</hi> Where take notice of two things.</p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:115397:74"/>Thirdly, Doth not Chriſt comfort himſelf with this, that though he knew he ſhould go into hell, yet he fore-ſaw that God would not leave his ſoul there alwayes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>for thou wit not leave my ſoul in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Doth not St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeconded with the other Apoſtles, and all filled with the holy Ghoſt in the day of Pentecoſt, expreſly affirm, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>the God raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, looſing the paines of death,</hi> &amp;c? Now Chriſts body while it remained in the grave, was not in any pain, therefore it was his ſoul that at the hour of his reſurrection was looſed from thoſe paines and torments. But here two things ſeem to puzle you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That ſaying of Chriſts upon the Croſs not long before his expirement, <hi>John</hi> 19.30. crying, <hi>it is finiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he ſayeth to the penitent theef, <hi>this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, Luke</hi> 23.43. To which we anſwer ſeverally as followeth.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, We object a like place, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. where our Saviour ſaith unto his Father, ſome ſpace before his death—<hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> that is, I have almoſt finiſhed it: And how much more then might Chriſt ſo ſay when he had ſuffered ſo much more in the garden, before his Judges, and upon the croſs.</p>
                  <p>If you reply, <hi>That in the former place he ſpeaks of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi> we will rejoyn that he ſpeaks here of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and offering up of his corporal life, both to fulfil the types of the Old Teſtament, and to ſet us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of dying with him.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond we anſwer with <hi>Gillebert</hi> in <hi>Bernard,</hi> That as man conſiſts of three diſtinct parts, body, ſoul, &amp; ſpirit. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. ſeconded with <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.12. So did Chriſts humanity alſo conſiſt of the ſame parts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, 9, 10.—<hi>Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoyceth; my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope, for thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, nor ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Where the heart is the ſoul, and the fleſh the body; ſo the glory was his ſpirit, which <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo calls his honour: <hi>Gen</hi> 49.6. <hi>O my ſoul come not thou into their ſecret, unto their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115397:74"/>aſſembly mine honour be not thou united.</hi> Which two are diſſevered again by a gradation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9. <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> The which diſtinction of parts being moſt clear, we ſay then, that the ſpirit of Chriſt at his death immediately aſcended to God, according to thoſe words, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. aforeſaid, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> his body alſo was laid in the grave, yet ſaw no corruption, but his ſoul went to hell there to ſuffer for us the condign puniſhment of our ſins, in the proper place of puniſhment: Oh juſtice upon the ſurety to be trembled at for ever! O love in Chriſt never to be forgotten!</p>
                  <p>Secondly. You are deficient in ſetting forth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual crucifying, death and burial of Chriſt within us, ever ſince our fall: Of which as you here make no mention at all, ſo we juſtly fear you have no fight nor feeling. Yet do theſe enſuing Scriptures with many others give a luculent teſtimony of the ſame, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.—<hi>He is the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world.</hi> If you here anſwer, <hi>That he was ſo in Gods decree,</hi> we reply that Gods decree is ſaid to be before the world, and before all ages.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 53. ſpeaks throughout of the ſufferings of Chriſt as a thing paſt, and done both in himſelf and others, where the ninth verſe cannot be verified of Chriſts ſufferings in the fleſh; <hi>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death.</hi> For, though Chriſt was crucified with two theeves, yet he was buryed alone in a tombe which <hi>Joſeph</hi> a righteous man had prepared for himſelf. In which place the Holy Ghoſt holds forth two things; the place of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward burial, and the cauſe of his death.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſt is ſlaine and buryed in two ſorts of men, firſt in the openly wicked, and ſecondly in thoſe that are rich in the wiſdom and holineſs of the fleſh, ſudh as were the Scribes and Phariſees: The cauſe why we let him dye, or ſlay him, is, for that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115397:75"/>to do any violence, nor is deceit found in his mouth. See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. For the further proof of what we have in hand, where the Apoſtle cryeth out, <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you,</hi> before whom Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified in you and among you? Now we all know that Chriſt in his humanity ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (<hi>Revel.</hi> 11.8.) and not <hi>in Galatia:</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. The Apoſtle tels them who fall away from Chriſt, <hi>That they crucifie afreſh the Son of God;</hi> which he could not truely charge upon them, if they had not crucified him once afore.</p>
                  <p>Finally, St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.6. <hi>you have condemne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, which words muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtod of Chriſt within us, as the following words e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, <hi>and he reſiſteth you not;</hi> for Chriſt for a time ſuffers patiently in us, and that as a lamb led to the ſlaughter; but if men repent not, he will riſe up like a Lyon to devour them. We here ſay nothing that the Farmers of the Vineyard (which is our heart) do not onely evilly entreat the other motions and meſſengers of God, but kill the heir alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.38, 39. Nor that <hi>John</hi> hath foretold us, that <hi>all Nations ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whom they have pierced,</hi> and bewail the ſame in a time of grace, to which he ſaith Amen, <hi>Revelations</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p>In your fift Section you comfort your ſelves and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with vain words, the dreams and devices of men; for though it is true which you ſpake in your laſt Section, that Chriſt was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfil it; yet hath he not by his perfect obedience and ſacrifice of himſelf, which he through the eternal ſpirit once offered up to God, fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God for us in any regard, but to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the curſe of the Law which was due unto us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Nor is it true that he hath purchaſed a ful recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for men with God, by that his outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor finally doth it appear out of the Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that by the ſame means he hath purchaſed an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115397:75"/>in the Kingdom of Heaven for all or any of thoſe whom the Father hath given unto him. And though the proof of what you have affirmed on the contrary lyeth on your part, yet we will briefly ſhew you our remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is certain that as Chriſt was a man, and ſo a creature, he did owe unto his Father a perſonal and perfect obedience in fulfilling the Law; how then could he perform the ſame for us alſo?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All men in <hi>Adam</hi> were created to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form perfect obedience to Gods Law and Will in their own perſons; neither doth it appear, that God hath ſince releaſed them of that obligation; nor did <hi>David</hi> think that he was or could be diſcharged there from, when he thus confeſſed and prayed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.73. <hi>Thy hands have made me, and faſhioned me, O give me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that I may learn thy Commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Moral Law requires of us a perfect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it, not by a deputy, or ſurety, but in our own perſons. In which regard the renewing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace of Chriſt is moſt requiſite for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be ſulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit:</hi> But his outward active obedience therein helps us no further, but as an example to be followed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is yet no other way unto life left for the ſons of men, but by the fulfilling of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; witneſs our Saviour's own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> and Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep the Commandements, that they may have right unto the tree of Life, and may enter through the gates into the Citie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Our Saviour ſaith thus unto us by way of anticipation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18, 19. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil; for verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115397:76"/>paſs, one jot or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled.</hi> And leaſt we ſhould dream that he by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law for us hath exempted us from it, or any way abated its requiring, he ſaith at the next verſe, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever threfore ſhal break one of theſe leaſt Commandements, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But whoſo ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led great in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> how then can Chriſt by his outward obedience ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for us, or in our behalf? nor is there any one Scripture which ſo much as colourably ſpeaks for you, but that <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. which yet will bear a better ſenſe, <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one man, ſhall many be made righteous;</hi> for we have proved before, and ſhall now again evidence it further out of the 14 verſe, that there are more <hi>Adams</hi> beſides our firſt progenitor, and namely one within us, by whoſe diſobedience, eſpecially if not ſoly we are made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And it it is more clear that there is a Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the beleevers as well as without them, by whoſe grace and ſpiritual obedience many are made holy and righteous.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, namely the 14, verſe you may obſerve that there is an <hi>Adam</hi> from whom death raigns, the which ſay we is our <hi>Adam,</hi> our earthly or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That there is a ſpiritual <hi>Moſes</hi> or time in us, till which death raigns, namely, the time of Gods drawing grace, as is hinted in the name of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which alſo is the time of Gods delivering his <hi>Iſrael</hi> from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpiritual <hi>Pharoah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That men are not ſaid here to ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> to wit, our firſt fathers tranſgreſſion, but after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There are ſome which ſin not after that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, but another way, as we have ſhewed before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Edom</hi> the ſame name with <hi>Adam</hi> in the Hebrew conſonants, and conſequently in ſignification alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:115397:76"/>Fifthly, That there is an <hi>Adam</hi> which is, or was the figure of Chriſt, and that is our perſonal <hi>Adam</hi> alſo of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. <hi>And as we have born the Image of the earthy, ſo we alſo ſhall bear the Image of the heavenly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That though Chriſt be already come in the fleſh, yet here in this 14. verſe, he is ſpoken of as one yet to come, which doubtleſs is Chriſts coming in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>John</hi> 14.21.</p>
                  <p>Now for our ſecond task, You may pleaſe adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Apoſtle at the 17. verſe ſpeaketh thus, <hi>How much more ſhall they that receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſneſs, raign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Now ſince we cannot enter into life but by a perſonal obedience, as we ſhewed before; for what other intent ſhould the abundance of grace in Chriſt be more needful for us, then for the performing of that obedience, through which we attain unto the Kingdom and righteouſneſs of God? And ſo by one mans obedience, even that of Chriſt within us, are many made, not putatively, but really righteous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to verſe 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Prophets and Apoſtles ſpeak frequently of Chriſts obedience in us, but nowhere of his obedience for us more then of his ſuffering in our ſtead, or his ſetting of us a patern to be followed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Thou Lord wilt ordain peace for us, for thou haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi> Jer. 31.33. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, I will write it in their hearts.</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21. <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our, Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that great Shepherd of the ſheep through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>But I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me,</hi> Phil. 1.10. <hi>Being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115397:77"/>glory and praiſe of God.</hi> Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt, who ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> Rom. 8.4. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c. Now if the righteouſneſs of the Law may be fulfilled in us through the grace and help of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expreſly affirms it there, what great need was there that it ſhould be fulfilled for us? <hi>Fruſtrà fit per plura,</hi> &amp;c. Furthermore, as our diſobedience was both begun and perfected, with our own conſent &amp; endeavours, though not without the leading inſtigation and power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; is it not meet that our obedience likewiſe ſhould be both enterprized and accompliſhed with our wills and beſt concurrences, though guided and carried on, yea accompliſhed alſo by the grace of God, and the power of his Chriſt? Is not that which is done in us, or by u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, though in the ſtrength of Chriſt, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Law and requiring, much more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him, then that which is done without us, without our knowledge, endeavour, or conſent? We in the mean time remaining enemies and rebels, or but lazy and loytering ſervants. Indeed the outward and perſonal obedience of Chriſt as it was active, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in him as a Mediator, not onely as our <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or foregoer, but in order alſo to his ſuffering for us; for had he failed in his obedience to the Law, he might have ſuffered afterwards for his own ſins; but could not have ſatisfied for ours. And as Chriſt could not by his outward and perſonal obedience ſatisfie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſtice for that perſonal obedience which we out ſelves ought, and which by his grace and help we may perform, ſo he did not by the ſame obedience purchaſe a reconcilement between us and God, as you here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith, chap. 3.3. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> Although God affects us as a work of his hands, yet ſo long as the body of ſin, which is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, remains in us, we can neither be reconciled unto him, nor he to us: <hi>For what fellowſhip hath righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115397:77"/>darkneſs?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Therefore it is ſaid in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>That God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their preſpaſſes unto them, and bath committed unto us the word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, <hi>we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> Where we pray you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt is not ſaid to have done the work, to wit, by his obedience or ſufferings, as you conceive, but to be doing of it ſtill; <hi>viz.</hi> by his grace and ſpirit ſlaying the enmity aforeſaid, in, and for thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve aright on him, and follow him in his like obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the ground of the emnity between us and God, lieth on our part, who hate him, his ways and righteouſneſs, through the ſin that dwelleth in us. And therefore the Apoſtle prayes us, yea in a beſeeching manner, to be reconciled unto God. And though two places, at the firſt view, upon which you mainly ground, may ſeem to favour your aſſertion, yet being rightly underſtood, they do not patrocinate the ſame at all: the firſt is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Croſs,</hi> having ſlain the emnity thereby: But here you may take notice, that the body ſpoken of is his myſtical body, and the croſs whereby the emnity is ſlain, is his ſpiritual croſs, like patience, or ſufferance: for by that we overcome every temptation of ſin, according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>James</hi> 1.4. <hi>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing:</hi> This is that croſs (and not afflictions themſelves, as the world conceives) which Chriſt commandeth thoſe that will follow him into life to take upon them, for the denying of themſelves, or the putting off the old man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we alſo are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115397:78"/>with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your other place upon which you rely, is that of <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. <hi>And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf, by him I ſay, whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven; And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh to preſent you holy and unblameable, and unreprovable in his fight.</hi> Where you may take theſe things into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whom he reconcileth; All the members of the Church who are regenerate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From what; from the enmity in their minds, whereby they are ſet upon wicked works.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Where; through the ſpiritual blood of the Covenant, or the ſpirit of grace, which is called the blood of his croſs, becauſe it is then ſent unto us, and poured down upon us, when we are upon the croſs with him, and ſuffer with him, not yeelding unto tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That Chriſt is ſaid to be ſtill doing of that work, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, In what way as a precedent for us he hath done it, to wit, in the body of his fleſh, through death, as theſe enſuing Scriptures ſhew, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>'Tis a faithful ſaying, for if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that it is unpoſſible to have reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and communion with God, unleſs it be in ſuch a way, the Apoſtle witneſſes likewiſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>This then is the meſſage we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all; If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> we lye, and haue not the truth; But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far of Chriſt's ſpiritual and true reconciling us unto God, which is then perfected and conſummate,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115397:78"/>when beſides the ſlaying of the enmity aforeſaid, he hath made us in all things of one ſpirit with the Father. For which unity and reconcilement he prayeth, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the purchaſing of an everlaſting inheritance for us, eternal life is the free gift of God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. And as the Father hath it in his hand to beſtow, ſo it is in the Sons gift like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and conſequently as it ſeems to us, he needs not to purchaſe it. But if you will call the fulfilling of that way and proceſs, whereby the faln man muſt attain it, the way &amp; race of obedience aforeſaid, a purchaſing of it, it is by the inward and ſpiritual obedience of Chriſt, eſpecially that we attain; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>For ye have need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the promiſe.</hi> Howbeit his outward paſſive obedience was requiſite thereunto, without which as we could not be delivered from the curſe, ſo neither could we come to inherit life. By this you ſee we ſtand in need of an inward and ſpiritual mediation from Chriſt, aſwel as that outward, of which alone you here ſpeak. Nor can we partake of the benefit of the outward, till qualified, and prepared firſt thereunto by the work of the inward.</p>
                  <p>In your Sixth Section, you proclaim your great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or ſmall regard of our great and moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry redemption from the power of ſin and Satan, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. "That the work of redemption was not actually wrought till after Chriſts incarnation: For were not the fathers before and after the flood, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and other holy Saints in the Old Teſtament, in their reſpective times ſpiritually ſaved and redeemed by Chriſt? And much more doth that great ſecret of the Father's ſparing and forbearing us along time for his Sons ſake, who in patience and meekneſs hath been led as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and the end of whoſe long ſufferance in us is ſalvation, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks,

You grant alſo that he is the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world: But whereas you add for a proof thereof out of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.9. <hi>That Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> That ſpeakes of his immutable Deity, and not of his humanity, though now made unchangeable. Yet this we ſay brethren, ere we leave this Section, that you hold forth a very lame and imperfect redeemer, which which hath indeed redeemed us by his death from the curſe of the Law, when our iniquities are put away from us: but who muſt redeem us from all our corruptions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> who muſt ſave and deliver us out of the hand of all our enemies? who muſt inable us to keep and fulfil the Law of God? who muſt renew the Image of God in us? Is not the true Chriſt <hi>made of God unto us wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſanctification, as well as redemption?</hi> 1 Cor 1.30.</p>
                  <p>In your Seventh Section, As we grant it to be true, that Chriſt in the entire office of a Mediator, acteth according to both natures joyntly, or ſeverally, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires, doing by each that which is proper to its ſelf; ſo perhaps it may be granted, that ſometimes in the Scriptures, by reaſon of the unity of the perſon, that which is proper to one nature, is attributed to the perſon denominated by the other. Howbeit, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which you refer us, do not prove ſo much; for that of <hi>Acts</hi> the 20.28.</p>
                  <p>Its true, Firſt of Chriſt in the Godhead, that he hath purchaſed his Church with his own blood, having redeemed it from the power of Satan by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To that of <hi>John</hi> 3.13. it may be ſaid, that as Chriſt is ſpiritually born in us, he is the Son of man which comes from Heaven, and is, or dwells in the heavenly being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115397:79"/>Finally, To 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16, It may be truly anſwered, that Chriſt the Son of God hath laid down his life for us, while he died in us, to keep off the deſerved wrath of God from us, and to preſerve us from the death threatned in the Law; as alſo to ſet us an example, how we may in following him overcome ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover life again, we ſeeking his grace and help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>In your eighth, and laſt Section, being like checquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work you have black as well as white, errour as well as truth: where your firſt affirmation <q>That Chriſt doth certainly and effectually apply and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his redemption to all thoſe for whom he hath purchaſed it,</q> will prove falſe in what ſenſe ſoever it be taken.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, If we here underſtand Chriſt's outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as you undoubtedly do, that being made for all ſinners, as we have proved by manifold Scriptures, it is not by him applyed unto all men, as your ſelves will confeſs: but if we here take up the inward and ſpiritual redemption of Chriſt; that is not purchaſed for us, but we are rather purchaſed by it; and in the very working of it, it being an inward work of Chriſts, it muſt needs be effectually applyed alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas you ſay, <q>That Chriſt makes interceſſion for all ſuch as he bath redeemed;</q> it is falſe alſo; for ſome deny even him that bought them, and that in an Apoſtatical way, and by <hi>bringing in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſies, whereby they bring upon themſelves ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.1. But we juſtly doubt you whether you underſtand aright what the interceſſion of Chriſt doth mean. For his interceſſion at large, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends his whole office of mediation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. but to take his interceſſion for his ſupplicative office, as you here intend it conſiſts principally, if not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the ſpiritual interceſſions which he makes unto God for &amp; in his Saints by his holy ſpirit. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.26, 27. As for his interceſſion at large, of which we conceive the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115397:80"/>Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Chriſt uſeth or imployeth that for none other, but thoſe whom the Father hath called and given unto him, and for them alſo ſo long as they continue with him. For <hi>the Lord is with us while we are with him.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28 9. The like we ſay of his revealing his Myſteries unto them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the word or without it, and of his effectual perſwading of them by his Spirit to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Where again you are miſtaken; for God onely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates, and makes known his truth unto us, but it is our part to ſet to our ſeal thereunto. &amp; in our power to withhold the ſame. What you ſpeak alſo of Chriſts governing the hearts of all thoſe whom he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meed, by his word and ſpirit, and of the overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all their enemies by his almighty power and wiſdom in ſuch manner and wayes as he ſees good; all theſe may be true or falſe according to the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Yet here you tacitely grant or imply Chriſts inward or ſpiritual mediation, though you own it not for ſuch a work. Yea, which is more to be wondered at, you here import that Chriſt by his almighty power doth overcome and ſubdue in and unto his redeemed people all their enemies; to wit, Satan and their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which elſewhere you hold to be unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable here, or not wholly to be ſubdued in this life. But truth is ſo evident and forcible, that where it is not narrowly watched and ſuppreſſed, it will break forth at unawares.</p>
                  <p>By all this which in this Chapter we have ſet forth, if the Lord open your eyes rightly to read it, we hope you will be brought to acknowledge that the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, concerning the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the faith, are already come to paſs, and that forewarning of his, that there ſhould ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, is fulfilled, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there ſhould be great need and cauſe for the Goſpel to be preached anew to all the world, as Chriſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115397:80"/>himſelf foretold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. and that mercy or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was foreſhewed to <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 14.6.7. For even thoſe Authors whom ye counted the greateſt lights of this laſt age, have very little ſight or knowledge of that great Myſtery Chriſt Jeſus in you, the hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.27. Yea, they have been all the publiſhers of a falſe conceived Mediator, or Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115397:82"/>me?</hi> But that place in which the Lord ſpeakes of a child ſhortly to be born unto the Prophet, and to be called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> as ſome moſt learned expoſitors affirm, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16. Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſigne, <hi>Behold a Virgin (or a young woman,</hi> for the word ſignifies both) <hi>ſhall conceive, and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel. Butter and hony ſhall he eate, that he may know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, for before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, the land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you may pleaſe to obſerve theſe things with us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That though this place be commonly underſtood of our Saviour, yet it is a great miſtake; for his proper name was <hi>Jeſus</hi> and not <hi>Immanuel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This child was to be born ſhortly after this prophecy, and is given to the Jewes as a ſign and token of a ſudden deliverance from <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Remaliah</hi> before the child ſhould be of age, and knowledge to refuſe the evil and chuſe the good.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, The prophet in the next Chap. triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the enemies of the Church alludes to this very name, as if the child were then in being, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.10. ſaying, <hi>Take counſel together, and it ſhall come to nough, ſpeak the word and it ſhall not ſtand, for God is with us;</hi> Where it is in the original <hi>Immanuel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved, is, that this child even from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But to come to your third Section, where our main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt begins. Beſides a miſtake in the very firſt entrance, Man that is fallen into ſin, being by you taken for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, no ſmal miſtake, as we have proved before;</p>
                  <p>You are firſt defective in that you diſtinguiſh not of the different ſtates of ſin.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, to maintain that which is true in it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that the faln man cannot without preventing grace by his own ſtrength convert himſelf, or haply prepare
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115397:82"/>himſelf thereunto: you lay ſuch grounds as are either falſe or at leaſtwiſe improper, of which anon.</p>
                  <p>But firſt you ſpeak of a ſtate of ſin into which man is faln, as though there were but one ſuch, whereas there is a manifold ſtate in ſin, one againſt God the Father, another againſt the Son, and a third againſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. There is a ſtate of ſin before regeneration, and another under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, 14. there is a ſtate of ſin before mans firſt converſion, and another after their final falling away, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. as there is a threefold degree of righteouſneſs, and grace, wherein ſome are <hi>Babes,</hi> ſome <hi>youngmen,</hi> and ſome <hi>old men;</hi> ſo there is a threefold ſtate, or age in ſin. So the Lord ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.16. <hi>That the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Amorites is not yet full;</hi> and complaines, Jer. 9.3. <hi>That the ſinners proceeded from evil to worſe;</hi> finally there is a ſin unto death, and a ſin which is not unto death, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.</p>
                  <p>Now the falſe grounds aforeſaid, which you lay for the eſtabliſhing of a truth, are theſe, <q>That the faln man hath loſt all ability of wil to any ſpiritual good accompanying ſalvation.</q> That a natural man is altogether averſe from from any ſuch good: The ground that you here improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply is, "That the man is dead in ſin.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, tis a raſh, and ungrounded aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration; for you will not deny, That to become a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to have our wicked thoughts forgiven us, to hear the word preached, to eat, and drink at Chriſts table, to keep the commandements of the ſecond Table, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, and finally to dye the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are all of them ſpiritual good things, and ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation; But we finde all theſe things wiſhed for, and deſired by thoſe which you count unregerate; for King <hi>Agrippa</hi> hearing Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> defence, had more then a velleity, ſome good meaſure of inclination to become a Chriſtian, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Simon Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us</hi> entreated the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to pray for him, that his wicked thoughts might be pardoned, and that none of the evils they had ſpoken of might happen unto him, to hinder his ſalvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.24.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour tels us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26. <hi>That many will plead before him at the latter day, that they had heard him teaching in,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115397:83"/>their ſtreets, and had eaten, and drunke at his table.</hi> The young man who enquired of our Saviour what good thing he ſhould do to inherit eternal life, had from his youth kept the precepts of the ſecond table aforeſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. Yea our Saviour looked upon him and loved him on that behalf, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21.</p>
                  <p>Finaily, <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired to dye the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that his latter end might be like his, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.10.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond ground that the natural man is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther averſe from any thing that is good: it is alike errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the former, whether we take a natural man for the earthly man, as he is ſtill created of God in innocency, or for the faln man in his unregenerate eſtate as you mean.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt notion the natural man can both will and act according to his firſt integrity, till he diſables, and corrupts himſelf by falling, as <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Edom</hi> a type of this man did ſeek to pleaſe and obſerve his father. And you may remember that the Apoſtle would have us in malice and naughtineſs to be like children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. But many natural men taken in your own ſenſe, are not utterly averſe from all good things: even <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf heard <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt gladly, and not only willed, but did many things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Doctrine and precepts, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. And <hi>Moſes</hi> having ſet before all Iſrael, life and bleſſing, with death and curſing, <hi>Deut</hi> 30.19. he there expreſly commands them to chuſe life, <hi>That both they and their ſeed might li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Firſt, That all faln men are not alike extenſively cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that is, they are not all alike enclined to all fins, but ſome to voluptuouſneſs, and prodigality, more then to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs or the like. And though <hi>David</hi> a King prayeth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115397:83"/>thus againſt covetouſneſs, <hi>Encline my heart to thy Teſtimo. nies, and not to covetouſneſs, Pſal.</hi> 119.36. Yet <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, "That he was never tempted to that ſin. Whence it will neceſſarily follow that ſuch a man is not equally averſe to all good, but to ſome vertues more then to others. The Phariſees though inclined to pride and covetouſneſs were not ſo propenſe to ſenſuality and uncleaneſs, as ſome of the Publicans were, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 12. and conſequently they did not ſo much abhor ſobriety, temperance, and chaſtity as the others did, nor did the other ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſate ſincerity, liberality, and humility as the Phariſees did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You may take notice that all faln men are not alike intenſively depraved; ſinners do gradually ſinks into ſin by cuſtome and continuance therein; ſo the Lord ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.46, 47. <hi>That Jeruſalem had more deeply corrupted her ſelf, then her elder ſiſter</hi> Samaria, <hi>or her younger ſiſter</hi> Sodom, and by conſequence ſhe was more averſe to good then either of them both.</p>
                  <p>And our Saviour affirms, that <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſadia</hi> were more averſe from repentance and amendment then <hi>Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> Luk. 10.13. And though it fares thus with the divel and his Angels, yea and with all thoſe men who through pride, malice, and deſperation are incorporated into him, yet we hope that the caſe or ſtate for the preſent is not ſo evil or deſperate with any other, as you here would make it with lapſed men. For to be utterly averſe from all good, is a moſt forlorn and deplorable condition, and their very incorrigible ſtate of whom the Lord complaines, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good who are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for your ground improperly and impertinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <q>That becauſe man ſince his fall is dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and ſins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 5. he cannot, therefore by his own ſtrength convert himſelf, or at all prepare himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we ſay, It is neither a lively nor a forcible kind of arguing; for it muſt be conſidered to what kind of life men by their fall become dead, not to their natural life
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115397:84"/>ſurely; for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of her that liveth in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſaith, <hi>that ſhe is dead whilſt ſhe liveth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. Here then as he chargeth her with a ſpiritual death, ſo he grants her a natural life ſtill remaining.</p>
                  <p>It is then to the former light of Chriſt, or life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that we are dead by our fall, as it is written <hi>Act.</hi> 8.33. <hi>That the life of Chriſt is taken from the earth,</hi> and Iſa. 58.8. <hi>That he was cut off from the land of the living.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hereunto the Apoſtle tels the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that in their unbelief, <hi>they were at thee time without Chriſt,</hi> Eph 2.12. and conſequently without power to do good, till we receive that again by grace.</p>
                  <p>But what is that to the willing, and nilling faculty which is a natural and eſſentiall property to the ſoul? Muſt that be dead in the man alſo, and he become a meer paſſive block or a dead trunk, as you would have him? we have proved before that even the faln man can both will and act ſome kinds of righteouſneſs, at leaſtwiſe towards man; witneſs that young man in the Goſpel before ſpoken of: But here to diſintangle you and others we will firſt breifly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, we muſt diſtinguiſh, between free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will and coaction, the latter of which may befal man, but not the will of man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, betwixt a will that willeth or nilleth with full conſent, and a mixt will, wherein the one party is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>For I am in a ſtrait between two, deſiring to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Betwixt an indifferency of will or <hi>aequilibriu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> to good or bad, and a will enclined more to that which is good, then to the evil. This we take to have been the ſtate of will in or firſt parents, if not of all men yet before they fall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Betwixt a will more enclined to the evil, then to the good, and a will inflexible.</p>
                  <p>The former of theſe may be found after our fall gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115397:84"/>in men, according to their inchoated, or more perfect habits in evil.</p>
                  <p>The latter of theſe is found in no man till he be wholly incorporated in the pride, and malice or deſperation of the divel. That the will of man after the fall is not wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, till ſuch a diabolical incorporation, we prove by theſe few inſtances inſtead of many.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Pharoah</hi> that proud and obſtinate Tyrant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the firſt he was moſt averſe to obey Gods voice, and let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go; yet he was brought to it by degrees, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he fully conſented, by Gods Judgements upon him and his people, together with their perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe ſix hundred thouſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who harkening to their unbelieving ſpies or ſearchers of the good land, refuſed to go up &amp; fight againſt their enemies, afterwards being made ſenſible of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt them, did of their own accord go up and fight againſt the <hi>Amalekites</hi> in the mountain, even then when <hi>Moſes</hi> forbad them, and threatned them with capital danger, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>A moſt evident example of the vertibility of mans will, <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, though he would not be warned by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours diſcovery of his treaſon aforehand, nor by his threatning of the enſuing danger, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20, 21. Yet afterwards his will turned, and he brought the money again which had corrupted him, truely confeſſing his great wickedneſs Wiſdome it ſelf, or Chriſts declareth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20.—30. though many will not turn to him at his calling or reproof, yet when it is too late, the door of mercy being ſhut againſt them in the time of their great calamity, <hi>this will turn to him and ſeek him early,</hi> that is, <hi>diligently.</hi> So that mans will is never finally obſtinate till it be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devilled.</p>
                  <p>But from theſe laſt inſtances we ſhould be warned <hi>to ſeek the Lord while he will be found,</hi> Iſa. 55.6. Where the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt concluds thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee in the time when thou maiſt be found. Surely in the great waterfloods</hi> (of Gods deſtroying calamities) <hi>they</hi> (that is the wicked) <hi>ſhall not come nigh him:</hi> But to go on in our diſtinctions, we muſt in the fifth place diſtinguiſh
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115397:85"/>betwixt freewill, and power, <hi>voluntatem &amp; arbitrium;</hi> for the one may be had, where the other is wanting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Between a free will, or agency and ſome ſtrong inclination of nature, to this or that object, both which may ſtand together.</p>
                  <p>As firſt in God, who is ſtrongly inclined to the good, and Sathan who propends wholly to the evil, yet doth act freely without compulſion, though not without ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or ſtrong influence of nature.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place, the cauſes why the faln man doth not will the good which he might, are theſe among others.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the ignorance of that good—<hi>ignoti nulla cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> Thus the ignorance of things promiſed, hinders the ſeeking of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond let is a depraved judgement, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9. for I <hi>verily thought with my ſelf, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t I ought to do many things againſt the name of Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third impediment is the want of due remembrance, and ſerious conſideration of what we know in generall, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He filthineſs is in her skirts, ſhe remembred not her latter end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth bar is the power of Temptation, of which the Apoſtle complaines, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.8.</p>
                  <p>A filth and a powerful obſtacle is habit and cuſtome in ſin, of which that is verified. — <hi>Qui non eſt ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Gods final deſertion, one of the heavyeſt of Judgements, is an unremovable obſtacle to the willing of good, becauſe ſeconded with Satans power.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may take a view, how far the faln man can will good, convert himſelf or prepare himſelf thereunto, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far forth as men have ſome light of nature left or new illumination, and convincing grace, the which of all other is moſt neceſſary for the work of a true converſion. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf, it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This may be done with the more facility, ſo far as they are chaſtned by the hand of the Lord, and make
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115397:85"/>a good uſe of it, which made the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> to pray as he doth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Correct me O Lord, yet in judgement; and not in thine angor, leſt thou bring me to nothing.</hi> Howbeit in all this the Lord ſeems to lay no violent hand upon the will, but works upon it by underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, judgement, and reaſon, with the uſe of ſenſe; and becauſe he is the Author of the new underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judgement, which leads and drawes the will, he is ſaid to work the will alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. for, <hi>Cauſae cauſae eſt etiam cauſa cauſaei.</hi> But the main way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the man after illuminating or preventing grace can prepare himſelf to turn his heart or will, is by frequent meditation, and deep conſideration of what he knows by grace or nature.</p>
                  <p>In your two laſt Sections, Firſt according to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſtribution, you diſtinguiſh the condition of converted ſinners into a State of Grace and a State of glory; but albeit there be different degrees in their new Metamorphoſis, or change, yet their leaſt eſtate in regeneration is a State of Glory, as on the contrary the higheſt degree of that change, and exaltation is a ſtate of Grace.</p>
                  <p>For the proof of the firſt of theſe conſider what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are transformed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3. — <hi>Through the knowledge of him who hath called us unto Glory and Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the evidencing of the latter, weigh well what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writeth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>wherefore gird up the loins of your minde, be ſober and hope to the end, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> See alſo 1 Pet. 3.7. <hi>as heirs together of the Grace of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more particulary for your fourth Section, As in the beginning of it you attribute too much to the firſt work or degree of our regeneration: ſo you detract too
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115397:86"/>much, from the laſt, and higheſt period of the ſame in the end of that Section.</p>
                  <p>For firſt you ſay, but not truely, <q>That when God converts a ſinner, and tranſlates him into the State of Grace, he preſently freeth him from his natural bondage under ſin, and by his grace alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him to will and to do that which is ſpiritually good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here brethren, you go too far; for the Apoſtle in the behalf of the young Babes or converts, complains thus, Rom. 7.8, 9. <hi>For to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nde not; for the good that I would, I do not, and the evil that I would not, that do I.</hi> How then are they freed, when the Apoſtle ſaith, ver. 23, <hi>He findes another Law in his members not only warring againſt the Law of his minde, but bringing him captiue to the Law of ſin in his members,</hi> whereupon he cryes out, verſe 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from this body of dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Is a bondage then againſt your wils, no captivity? yea it is the moſt grievous bondage of all others in our ſenſe and feeling, though not ſo perilous to the ſoul, as a willing ſubjection unto ſin. Indeed it is true of the young in Chriſt, which the Apoſtle writs to them of that age, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.14. <hi>I have written unto you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one;</hi> But the Babe in Chriſt cannot attain thereunto while he is a chide.</p>
                  <p>Now in the cloſe of that Section, you flag and fall as much too ſhort, ſaying, <q>That this convert at his higheſt pitch (for ſo you mean) by reaſon of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption doth not perfectly, nor only will that which is good,</q> but willeth that which is evil alſo.</p>
                  <p>The which though it be true of the Infants aforeſaid, and perhaps may ſometimes be verified of the middle
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115397:86"/>ort, yet it is not true of the old or aged men in Chriſt, ſuch as the Apoſtles themſelves were; as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before.</p>
                  <p>In your laſt Section, you do as you are wont, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transferring the ſtate of Glory in which the will of man is made immutably good, out of this world, but herein you are ſome what miſtaken, if we may give credit to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12, &amp; 21. <hi>C.</hi> 1.2.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S you had no calling to deliver many things here uttered by you, ſo they are not very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual or true; In which kind the firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not the leaſt culpable; for therein you deliver theſe paradoxes among others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <q>That God is pleaſed in his appointed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time to call all thoſe effectually whom he hith predeſtinated unto life;</q> the which is not true: For as thouſands dying in their Infancy never fell (which thing we have before ſufficiently proved) ſo ſuch neither need, nor have any ſuch calling as you here deſcribe. For though our Saviour ſpeake thus of all faln men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> yet chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have no need to be conformed to ſuch converts; for of them, and with ſuch as they are is the Kingdom of heaven repleniſhed, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſay with no leſs untruth, <q>That God calleth only thoſe effectually whom he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated unto life,</q> which in your ſenſe are the ſmaller part of men: But as you make the univerſal father, and common Saviour of all mankinde, a partial God in his decree of election, or predeſtination, ſo you make him an accepter of perſons in his calling of ſinners to repentance, both contrary to manifold and cleare Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Here then we muſt aſſert thoſe two things againſt you for the vindicating of Gods honor, and the ſtopping of all mouths.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Lord cals unto him all the ſons of men, who are faln from him, and that with ſufficient though not alwayes with a ſucceſsful calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:115397:88"/>Secondly, That he calls ſome of theſe which retain not, with more induſtry and earneſtneſs, then many that come unto him, continue with him, and are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the end; for the firſt of thoſe we will here ſay nothing of that which our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>That many be called, but few are choſen:</hi> which though it overthrow the laſt Section, yet it comes not up to a full proof of what we are now to maintain, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and particular call of all men that are faln from God, and who are capable of inſtruction. But theſe following texts will carry it before them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. where the Apoſtle would have all men in general and in particular, who have not ſinned that ſin unto death, prayed for upon this ground; <hi>For this is good, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God, who would have all men ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> If he would have it ſo, what hinders, but that he both may and doth bring all men to the knowlekge of ſo much truth as whereby they may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>To this agree the words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. where he ſhews the true and onely cauſe why all that are loſt do periſh, <hi>But to thoſe that are contentious, and diſobey the truth, and obey unrighteouſneſs, ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath,</hi> which is the ſame in effect with what he had before delivered, <hi>Chap</hi> 1 18. <hi>For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who withhold, or ſuppreſs the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you reply that the Apoſtle in the former place of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. ſpeaks, <hi>de generibus ſingulorum, That God would have ſome of all kinds and ſorts of men ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt here again urge the place of St. <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.9. which undoubtedly ſpeaks univerſally in the negative, and the affirmative, and ſo <hi>de ſingulis generum. Not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> Doth not <hi>Elibu</hi> ſpeak thus of Gods gratious dealing with all mankinde that are gone
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115397:89"/>aſtray? <hi>Job</hi> 33.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>For God ſpeaketh once, yea, twice, yet man perceiveth, or regardeth it not. In a dream, in the viſions of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring upon the bed: Then he openeth the eares of men, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their inſtruction. That he may withdraw man from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and hide pride from man. He keepeth back his ſoul from the pit, and his life from periſhing by the ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And having named many other means which God uſeth for the ſelf-ſame end, <hi>ver.</hi> 29.30. thus he ſums up all and concludes the point. <hi>Loe all theſe things God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worketh with man, to bring back his ſoul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living:</hi> And Job 34.23. <hi>For he will not lay upon man more then is right, that he ſhould enter into judgement with God;</hi> which thing according to the doctrine, all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> might do; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his ſin imputed to them, before, they were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſinners, and in him being deprived not onely of all wiſdom, holineſs, and power, but every way blinded and depraved, and that without a ſufficient help of grace to ridd, and deliver them, as to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them: And <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 27. he ſhews the cauſe why he ſtrikes wicked men, even for this refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory oppoſition apainſt his teachings and calls; <hi>He ſtriketh them as wicked men in the open ſight of others, becauſe they turned back from him, and would not conſider any of his wayes:</hi> whereas it was our duty to ſay to the Lord, as often as he teacheth and chaſtiſeth, as it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>verſe</hi> 31.32. <hi>It is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I know not, teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 35.10, 11. complaining of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, he ſaith, <hi>But none</hi> (that is very few of the ſtubborne ones) <hi>ſaith, where is God my maker, who giveth ſongs in the night? Who teacheth us</hi> (all mankinde) <hi>more then the beaſts of the earth, and maketh us Wiſer then the foul of Heaven.</hi> How can the wicked ſay to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. <hi>Job</hi> 21.11.22, 17. <hi>depart frou us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> if he were not preſent with them
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115397:89"/>at times teaching rebuking, drawing, and calling them, that he might turn them to him; yea, with their wills from their wiked and deſtructive wayes? doth not wiſdom utter her voice to all the fallen race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde? <hi>Prov,</hi> 8.4, 5. <hi>Unto you O men I call, and my voice is to the ſons of men. O ye ſimple underſtand wiſdom, and ye fools be ye of an underſtanding heart:</hi> yea, is not her invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as univerſal, and particular alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.4, 11. as the call and ſeductive allurements of folly is, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. for each of them uſeth the ſelf-ſame words. <hi>Whoſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither,</hi> &amp;c. yea, what is the true cauſe that wiſdome ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28, 29. <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not finde me:</hi> But this which followeth there <hi>verſe</hi> 29, 30, 31. <hi>For that they bated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord; They would none of my counſel, they deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all my repreof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of our firſt aſſertion; come we now to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <q>That ſome of thoſe which ſtand out, are more earneſtly and induſtriouſly called by the Lord, then many true converts,</q> which continue ſtedfaſt with the Lord: for which purpoſe take theſe places.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Gods gracious and effectual dealing with <hi>Cain</hi> when his wrath and envy was kindled againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: What could the Lord without offering violence to his will, do more to him then he did, ſaying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.6.7. <hi>Why art thou wrath? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lieth at the door:</hi> And then it follows, as one both judicious and skilful in the original hath it. <hi>Idque a te pendebit, tuque ei imperabis. And in thee ſhall be the will or deſire of it, and thou ſhalt have dominion over it,</hi> viz. <hi>if thou wilt ſeek that grace</hi> Did not the Lord alſo complain, that he had ſtriven with the men of the old world, till he was weary again? <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, my ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, for that be alſo is fleſh;</hi> yea, were not their ſpirits or human ſouls caſt into the priſon of Hell for their diſobedience, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115397:90"/>refractorineſs? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20 doth not the Lord ſay alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could have been done more to my vineyard, which I have not done unto it? Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> you will ſay, <hi>Is not God almighty? Could he not have compelled them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Yes; but he will not violate the order, which he hath ſet in our creation, he will not force the will, but deals with man as a free agent, by commands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, threatnings, rebukes, chaſtiſements, allurements, and rewards: So true is that of the Father, <hi>Nemo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitus fit bonus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this point, what can be more expreſs, then thoſe three enſuing texts, among many others, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Thou are not ſent to many people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and of an hard language, whoſe words thou canſt not underſtand; Surely, had I ſent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee: but the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not hearken unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 11.21. <hi>Woe unto thee</hi> Chorazin, <hi>woe unto thee</hi> Bethſaida; <hi>for if the mighty works which were done in thee, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>ond</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented long ago in ſackcloth, and aſhes;</hi> Of which text we ſpake before upon the laſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Finally, That of <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.21. brings full convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, <hi>The men of Niuive ſhall riſe in judgement with this generation, and condemn it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of</hi> Jonah, <hi>and behold a greater then</hi> Jonah <hi>is here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you demand here, what's the cauſe that theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate men do not anſwer Gods call and return?</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, It is not want of illumination, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; as we have ſhewed, nor want of reproof, as we have proved, but this let lies in mens abuſe of their free-will, as we heard before, <hi>Prov.</hi>

                     </gap> the Scribes and Phariſees were in the daies of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who taught them with power and authority, <hi>Matth</hi> 7.29. and whoſe doctrine was confirmed ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by miracles alſo. And others which know, and acknowledge that they are evil doers, yet do defer their return till it be too late, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28, 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid: Hence it is that they ſhall be filled with weeping and mourning for the opportunity which they have loſt, as the other ſhall be with envy and gnaſhing of teeth, the concomitant of pride, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25, 26, 27, 28. And theſe are Satans two wayes of deſtroying men; he either caſts them into the ſin of contention, wrath, and envy through the riches of their ſelf knowledge, ſelf-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſelf zeal, or into the ſtolen and pleaſant waters of voluptuouſneſs, or worldly cares, therein detaining them till they be drowned in ſenſuality; ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 9.22.

                  <p>The third falſhood which you affirm in you firſt Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, <q>That God calleth all his predeſtinate only by his Word and Spirit:</q> where we muſt grant you, that his Spirit is alwayes the cheif actor, and that oft times God is pleaſed to uſe his word, whether written or ſpoken, as an inſtrument in that work, but not alwayes as yourſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confeſs Section the third. Beſides the Lord hath many other inſtruments and means to call, and convert men, beſides his word, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhews at large, <hi>Joh.</hi> 33.14—29. of which alſo we ſpeak before: Yet are none more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or more effectual then Gods chaſtiſments both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.10. <hi>He that chaſhſeth the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, ſhall not he correct?</hi> Pſal. 119 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word.

                  <p>A fourth miſtake of yours there, is, <q>That you ſay all men are by nature in the ſtate of ſin and death;</q> For we have already proved that to be falſe. And doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27. <hi>That if the uncircumciſion, which is by nature fulfil the Law</hi> (taking it for granted, that ſome may do ſo) <hi>he ſhall judge thee, who by the letter, and circumciſion doſt tranſgreſs the Law.</hi> True it is, that the word nature is not always taken in one notion by the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but as by nature here he underſtands a ſtate of men without the written word, ſo by nature <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. (where he ſaith, that we were by nature the children of wrath as well as others) he intends either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, or a reality of the thing, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>you did ſervice to them which by nature are no Gods,</hi> that is, not really ſuch, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>A fifth errour of yours in that Section, is, that you ſay, <q>God in this his effectual calling of men, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will to that which is good,</q> wherein, as we ſaid before, he ſhould overthrow that courſe and order which himſelf hath ſet up, making us free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and leaving our wills free, and interminate. Yet we grant that the Lord bowes and inclines the wils of men, from evil to good, by illumination in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115397:91"/>and working upon the judgement as we ſaid before, but he laies no violent hands upon the will immediately.</p>
                  <p>Finally, you have other miſtakes in the firſt Section alſo, as when you ſay that God in his effectual calling of men takes away the ſtony heart, and gives them an heart of fleſh: for that is not wholly done in our firſt converſion, but in proceſs of time, by our clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſin, and renewing in Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Covenant, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. Nor are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts brought to Jeſus Chriſt at the firſt, as you here dream; for the father hath his work of regeneration upon us, ere we are brought to know or beleeve, on the Son for his worke of ſpiritual redemption, which is the ſecond ſtep or degree of our regeneration, as we ſhew in the ſequel of this tractate, Yea, <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſiſts the father in his work, or doth not continue in it, he is not brought by the father to the ſon to be ſaved by him from ſin and Satan,</hi> John 6.44.</p>
                  <p>Nor is your ſecond Section ſo ſound, or Orthodox in all points as we could wiſh it. For you ſay there, but not truly, <q>That he who is called of God is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſive, until quickned and renewed by the holy Ghoſt.</q> For though in the works of illumination, correction, and reproof, he is paſſive, yet afterward in the turning of his will and deſires to God, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he is active, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>For they themſelves ſhew of us, what mannor of entrance we bad unto you, and how ye turned to God from Idols, to ſerve the living and true God.</hi> So Acts 11.21. <hi>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great many beleeved, and turned to the Lord.</hi> Wherefore doth the Lord require this motion at our hands ſo often, if we cannot turn after inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and convincing grace? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 30. <hi>Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye and turn ye from all your tranſgreſſions;</hi> and verſe 32. <hi>Wherefore turn ye, and live.</hi> ſee <hi>Eze.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Joe.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you abate ſomething of your wonted rigour, in ſaying, <q>That all other elected
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115397:92"/>perſons (beſides infants) who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the miniſtry of the word, are regenerated, and ſaved by Chriſt, through the Spirit who worketh when, and where, and how he pleaſeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you grant then that there is an elect people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all nations, as <hi>John</hi> ſaw an infinite or innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of ſuch ſtanding before the throne of God, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white rober and palms in their hands, <hi>Re.</hi> 7.9. you have here yeilded that they may be called without the ordinary means of the word; and this is no other thing in effect, then what ye have here maintained. For if the Lord could do this in <hi>Elihu, Job, Rahab,</hi> the widow of <hi>Zarephta,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> (all which were converted without the word) what hindereth but that he can do the like all over the world, in all ages and generations of mankinde, if they obſtruct not his working. In this Section we paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that which you ſpake in the beginning of it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning elect infants, becauſe we know no other ſort of infants. And that ſuch need no regeneration, we have ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth and laſt Section you have heaped up together many untruths, as theſe by name.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, "That there are ſome perſons that are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; which being underſtood of a ſpecial, and final election is true, but being taken of Gods general and conditional election, is falſe, as before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſay, <q>That ſuch as are not elected, and ſo not ſaved, though they may be called by the miniſtry of the word, yet they receive onely the common operations of the ſpirit:</q> It is moſt certain that many who are not finally elected and ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a true and effectual calling vouchſafed from the father, have in ſome meaſure received a true faith, bringing forth repentance for a time, a true love tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to God, and bringing forth a temporary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, a true hope, which brought forth patience, yea, and ſome proportion of purifying and ſanctfying
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115397:92"/>grace, as is evident out of theſe Scriptures and others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. and <hi>chapt.</hi> 5.12. and <hi>chapt.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and <hi>chapt.</hi> 10.28, 29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You ſay, "That ſuch never came truly unto Chriſt, and therefore cannot be ſaved: where it is true, that ſuch can never be ſaved from the power of their ſpiritual enemies, who never came to Chriſt, nor Chriſt to them; yet many of them which were never choſen out of the furnace, nor in the end par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of eternal life, yet were brought for a time both to beleeve in Chriſt, and in ſome meaſure to obey him, who yet afterward fel from him, and loſt all that which they had wrought with their future hopes; of which number were thoſe apoſtate Diſciples of Chriſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>John</hi> 6.66. with <hi>Judas, Demas,</hi> and many others: Hence <hi>John</hi> warnes us in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtile verſe</hi> 8. thus, <hi>Looke to your ſelves, that we looſe not thoſe things which we have wrought.</hi> And Chriſt ſpeakes to the like effect, <hi>Revelations</hi> 3.11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, <q>You exclude from ſalvation all men not openly profeſſing the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where firſt, We pray you to conſider, whether ſuch perſons, as the Apoſtle ſeems to deſcribe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 26, 27. may not be ſaved by Chriſt naturally planted in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, May not many of the Jews as well under the Old Teſtament, as the New, though they know not, or beleeve not the myſtery of Chriſts incarnation, be ſaved by that faith which the Apoſtle deſcribes, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.6, thus; <hi>For he that comes is God muſt beleeve that God is, and that be is a rewarder of them that ſeek him,</hi> eſpecially if they expect, and ſeek the inward Kingdom of a ſpiritual <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> with victory over their Ghoſtly enemies through him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whether ſome that are not in all things of the ſame faith with the modern Chriſtians, whether <hi>Calviniſts, Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> may not poſſibly obtain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115397:93"/>ſalvation by ſuch a faith as we have here confeſſed?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whether ſuch as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi> who are Chriſts ſincere Diſciples, but dwelling in the midſt of perſecutors, dare make no open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith and hope, may not be ſaved in the end, and that by Chriſt in whom they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>

                  <p>Hence it is that as in your other Sections you have much of error: ſo in your firſt you have little of truth, where laying down the doctrine both po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively and negatively, you have been ſo unhappy for the moſt part; as to reject the truth, and fix upon the errour.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, firſt you ſay, <q>That all thoſe whom God effectually calleth,</q> he alſo freely juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which is not true of ſuch, as either reſiſt his call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of them who being brought to believe in Chriſt do by and by fal away again.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115397:96"/>are founded upon that moral ſenſe of being juſt, or made juſt, or of being free from unrighteouſneſs, which is the Apoſtles ſenſe in all his diſcourſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly you ſay poſitively, <q>That God juſtifieth by pardoning of ſins;</q> but though <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is uſed ſometimes for the puting away of ſins, and that by regeneration, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.77. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. and elſwhere, as well as for the pardon of ſins: Yet juſtification in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe lieth not in remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you ſay poſitively alſo, <q>That God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies men by accounting and accepting their perſons as righteous,</q> and you mean he doth ſo while they are otherwiſe both in heart and life. But God accounts of every man as he is; and though he is ſo gracious as to pardon, the guilt of ſins forſaken, and repented of, and ready alſo in Chriſt both to cleanſe us and renew us, becauſe he would not have us dye in our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet, as he ſpeaks to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he will by no means clear the guilty, or ſuch as continue in evil. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>He is a God of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. <hi>Doth not he ſearch the heart and try the reines, that he may give to every man according to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings,</hi> Jer. 17.20. See what he ſaith, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>Are there yet the treaſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wicked, and the ſcant meaſure that is abominable? ſhall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and the bag of deceitful weights?</hi> God indeed is ſaid to juſtifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. Yet not by accounting him righteous when he is wicked, but by cleanſing and renewing him, and ſo making him of ungodly a godly and righteous perſon.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly you ſay, <q>God juſtifies them not for any thing that is wrought in them;</q> which is falſe; for it is by ſomething wrought in us, that we are juſtified, and ſanctified, and by ſomething wrought in us alſo that we are juſtified, that is declared juſt before God and men in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:115397:96"/>Sixthly you ſay, "That ſuch are juſtified for Chriſts ſake alone, which is true of Chriſt and his work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, but not of Chriſt and his obedience without us, as you mean it. But why do you in theſe two laſt paſſages oppoſe that which is wrought in us to Chriſt, as if the father, and his Chriſt, with the Holy Ghoſt, were not the makers of every good work in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly you ſay, <q>That God in this work imputeth not faith,</q> or the act of believing unto us for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, contrary to expreſs Scriptures. Is it not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Gal</hi> 3.6. <hi>that Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſs?</hi> that is, the Lord accepted his believing (whereby he gave him that honor of his truth, omnipotency and faithfulneſs) as an acceptable duty at his hand, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded it with the promiſed righteouſneſs as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks <hi>chap.</hi> 2.23. Yea doth not the Apoſtle ſpeak thus expreſly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but to us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed if we believe in him who raiſed up our Lord Jeſus from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly you ſay, <q>That God doth not impute any other Evangelical obedience to men for their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</q> wherein you run full butt againſt the whole ſtream of the Scriptures, of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25, And it ſhall be our righteouſneſs, if we obſerve to do, <hi>viz.</hi> through the help of Chriſt, all theſe commandements before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.22. <hi>All his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he hath committed, ſhall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteouſneſs that he hath done he ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.4. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 10.4. <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.10. <hi>As it is written, he hath diſperſed abroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteouſneſs remaineth for ever.</hi> Now he that miniſtreth ſeed to the ſower, both mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115397:97"/>bread for your food, and multiplie your ſeed ſown, and increaſe the fruits of your righteouſneſs. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>James</hi> 1.22.23, 24. <hi>Rom,</hi> 2.13. <hi>For not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the ſame</hi> (and they onely) <hi>ſhall be juſtified,</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf doth acknowledge, <q>That foraſmuch as this obedience is performed with our conſents and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, though principally begun and ended through the grace and power of God, yet it is through the mercy and goodneſs of God imputed unto us, as if it were entirely ours.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly you ſay, <q>That men are juſtified by having Chriſts obedience and ſatisfaction imputed unto them,</q> but we have ſhewed before that the outward perſon and active obedience of Chriſt ſtands upon his own ſcore; he as a creature being a debtor to keep the Law, and is not imputed unto us, as his paſſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is through which we are diſcharged of thoſe ſins which we have repented of and left.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly you ſay, <q>That perſons to be juſtified reſt upon Chriſt,</q> and his righteouſneſs by faith; which is true of his internal righteouſneſs, as we have ſhewed, but not in your ſenſe: for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having ſpoken of the righteouſneſs of faith. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. doth explain himſelf at the 10. verſ. ſaying, <hi>That I may know him and the power of his reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. So the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. ſaith, <hi>That Abraham received circumciſion</hi> (which in it ſelf ſignifies and ſets forth ſanctification) <hi>as a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly whereas you ſay, <q>That they have not this faith of themſelves,</q> it is the gift of God, we grant it to be true of Gods illumination, revealing unto us the things which we knew not; but not of our credence which we yeeld unto the ſame, as we ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section beſides one of your former errors reſumed of faiths reſting upon an imagined righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, his outward obedience aforeſaid, you affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m two untruths more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115397:97"/>The firſt is, "That faith is the alone inſtrument of Juſtification, whereas the Publican, who went away juſtified, rather then the ſelf juſtifying Phariſee, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that mercy partly by his penitence, and partly by prayer, ſaying, <hi>Lord be merciful unto me a ſinner,</hi> Luk. 18.14. Furthermore the word of God is a bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our cleanſing and juſtification from ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now are ye clean through the word that I have ſpoken unto you,</hi> Joh 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth;</hi> ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we have ſhewed before that our obedience, both active and paſſive, is a way wherein, and ſo a mean and inſtrument whereby we attain juſtifying and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you ſay, but untruely, <q>That faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained with all other graces.</q> For though it is the high way to obtain whatſoever grace we want, yet at the firſt it is ſeconded but with two other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, to wit, hope and love. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Now abideth theſe three, Faith, Hope, and Love, but the greateſt of theſe is Love.</hi> And if it were attended at the firſt with all other graces, why doth the Apoſtle thus charge us? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>And beſides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs, love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly though you ſay truly, <q>That the faith which juſtifieth is no dead faith,</q> we may juſtly fear that ſuch a faith as ſeeks no living juſtification is ſcarce a lively faith.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section, firſt you harp upon that old ſtring, <q>That Chriſt hath diſcharged our debt, and ſatisfied Gods juſtice by his death;</q> which how far it is true or falſe, we have already declared: yet is our juſtification of freegrace, and ſo contrived, that both Gods exact juſtice (which can have no fellowſhip with iniquity) and his rich grace alſo might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115397:98"/>in the juſtification (that is the renewing and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section we acknowledge Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to juſtifie all ſinners if they oppoſe him not in the work, but not to juſtifie all the elect. For ſuch choſen ones as die in innocency need it not.</p>
                  <p>We aſſent alſo unto it, that Chriſt did in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time in his aſſumed humanity, die for the ſins of all offenders, as in his God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ead he dyeth in them from the time of their fall, but neither way doth he ſuffer death for all the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Tis granted likewiſe, that he is riſen again both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly, for the juſtification of ſinners, but not in your ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>But that which you add in the cloſe of the ſame Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <q>That they are not juſtified until the Holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Chriſt unto them,</q> is falſe. Not that we dream as ſome do, that men are juſtified either from eternity or from the time of Chriſts reſurrection, but that Chriſt in the work of our juſtification applyeth the ſpirit unto us, and not the Spirit him, as you here dream.</p>
                  <p>In your fifth Section, by not diſtinguiſhing of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>in ſieri &amp; in facto,</hi> you bring forth both confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and error.</p>
                  <p>For firſt you ſay, <q>That God doth continue to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the ſins of thoſe that are juſtified,</q> which is true of them that are now under the work, ſo far as they continue in faith and obedience, or after fals renew their repentance; but as for thoſe who are fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they have a general acquitance and diſcharge of all their ſins ſealed up unto them in and through the death of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14, 15, 16. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſanctified, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſs to us: For after that he had ſaid before, this is the Covenant that I will make with them after thoſe dayes ſaith the Lord, I will put my Lawes into their hearts, and in their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115397:98"/>minds will I write them, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more offering for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly whereas you ſay, <q>That the juſtified perſons can never fall away from the ſtate of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</q> it is falſe of perſons that are there <hi>in fieri,</hi> and true of them onely that are juſtified <hi>in facto vel potius perfecto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly whereas you grant, <q>That perſons juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may by their ſins, fall under Gods fatherly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and not have the light of his countenance reſtored unto them until they humble themſelves, confeſs their ſins;</q> beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.</p>
                  <p>This is true, yet not of thoſe perfect or conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ones, who fall not ſo either into ſin, or Gods diſpleaſure: but of the younger ſort onely in the time of their progreſs and growing up, who may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo faile, and ſuffer as you have affirmed, but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may through a wilful revolt, both fall away total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and remain under indignation finally.</p>
                  <p>As to your ſixth and laſt Section, becauſe we have deſcribed the way and means of juſtification more groundedly then ye have done, we can truely ſpeak it in your words, but not in your ſenſe, <q>That the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of beleevers in the Old Teſtament was in all theſe reſpects one and the ſame, with the juſtification of beleevers under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we leave this ſubject, give us leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of two things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That the means of our juſtification or ſpiritual redemption in Chriſt Jeſus, is principally his blood, the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, his promiſed ſpirit, <hi>Romans</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1.7. <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> 1.14. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9.14, 15.—22. compared with <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> 31.32, 33, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.25, 26, <hi>&amp;c. Hebrews</hi> 10.29. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.20.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:115397:99"/>The ſecond is that remiſſion of ſins wherein you place juſtification for the main, is to be had after ſin is put away by ſanctification and amendment, and not before, as you fondly dream both here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>For which purpoſe take theſe enſuing Scriptures. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſin ſhall not proſper, but but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy 33.8. <hi>And I will cleanſe them from all their iniquities, whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned againſt me.</hi> Mark 1.4. John <hi>preached the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Luke 24.47. <hi>And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations.</hi> Acts 5.32. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince, and a Saviour for to give repentance unto Iſrael and remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Acts 26.17, 18. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom I now ſend thee to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remiſſion of ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Hebrews 10.14. <hi>For by one offering hath he perfected for ever thoſe which are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all which we could adde that the bleſſedneſs which <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. lies firſt in the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of ſins by ſanctification, as the laſt words there import, and the reſt will bear it, and then in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them or the guilt of them pardoned in Jeſus Chriſt, which words may be thus rendered, <hi>O the bleſſedneſs of the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is taken away, and whoſe ſins are covered</hi> (or buryed with the like death of Chriſt) <hi>O the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom the Lord impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not iniquity</hi> (by letting him dye in his ſins as one fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and unpurged) <hi>and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore you have firſt committed great diſorder and confuſion in attributing all theſe alike unto all, not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which priviledges belong to all Saints, and which but to ſome who may abſolutely expect all or moſt of them, and who may expect the ſame conditionally onely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You take the high way here, as you have done elſewhere, to fill many who are not yet paſt danger, with ſecurity and preſumption.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, There are three degrees of Gods name, Image, or like being.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, Which is the fathers name, is written upon thoſe that beleeve on him, love, and obey him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, Which is Chriſts powerful and ſaving name, becomes written upon ſuch as are brought to know
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115397:100"/>him, to truſt in his ſaving office, and to ſeek his help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies, and who perſiſt ſo ſeeking.</p>
                  <p>The third, Which is the name of the holy Ghoſt, and the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the new name of Chriſt is engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely upon thoſe that have overcome all their enemies through the power of Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt are they that are never caſt off, and who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promiſes as heirs of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>But the other two, If they abide not in the Father, and in Chriſt after they know him, may fall ſhort of the promiſes, and be rejected.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the third form are paſt Gods fatherly chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they now ſin not, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. but the other two are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>As for the other, You tell us that all which are adopted to be the children of God, are ſealed to the day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; but none are ſo ſealed finally, and abſolutely, ſave the third ſort, of whom we ſpake before; the reſt are but ſealed conditionally, yet left in good hope. Yea, all thoſe priviledges which you further recite in this Chapter, muſt be neceſſarily thus underſtood; to wit, conditionally, of thoſe that are but inchoatively adopted; and abſolutely of ſuch onely as have accompliſhed the conditions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore you have here adopted many errours for truth though you have ſpoken ſome truth alſo at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; as <q>That all thoſe that are juſtified God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth in,</q> and for his onely Son Jeſus Chriſt, to make partakers of the grace of Adoption.</p>
                  <p>This is moſt true of thoſe whom God hath juſtified in our ſenſe, that is, purged from all corruption by the blood and ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt; for ſuch, and ſuch onely are abſolutely and finally adopted, and enjoy all the liberties and prerogatives here by you ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>But if you here underſtand initiated adoption, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes juſtification, taken both in your ſenſe and ours, and ſo your affirmation is erroneous.</p>
                  <p>It is true alſo that all they who are adopted in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, are taken into the number of Gods Children for the preſent; but the younger and weaker ſort may by their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115397:101"/>unthankfulneſs for ſo great a grace, by their future rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Apoſtacy be abdicated and caſt off for ever, 1 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 28.9. <hi>Romans</hi> 11.22. <hi>Behold therefore the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſeverity of God: on them that fell, ſeverity; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee, goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou ſhalt be cut off.</hi> Deuteronomy 32.19. <hi>When the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking of his ſons and daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord maketh all the regenerate partakers of the grace of conditional adoption, but onely the third ſort of final adoption; yet all theſe are protected by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and provided for as children, while they continue children; but not otherwiſe; all likewiſe have acceſs to the throne of grace (which is Chriſt Jeſus) who are brought to know him, and beleeve in his name, and who perſiſt in that their faith and in good will; but none other, neither they which yet know him not, nor ſuch as by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy crucifie him afreſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10.27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Let all thoſe who are incoatively adopted, bleſs God for that eſtate, and rejoyce in it. <hi>Galatians</hi> 4.6, <hi>And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son, whereby ye cry Abba, Father.</hi> 1 John 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God.</hi> Yet let us remember it is but a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate at the firſt, and a long time after. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16.17. <hi>For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage to fear again, but the ſpirit of adoption whereby ye cry Abba, Father; The ſpirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the the children of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him.</hi> And to the end that we may obtain a final and abſolute adoption. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving already ſpoken of Juſtification, this whole Chapter of ſanctification (which is but the Chriſtening of the ſame thing with a new name, as we have ſhewed before) might have been ſuperſeded; and as the whole diſcourſe is ſuperfluous, ſo many of your erroneous and unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified aſſertions, ſuch as thoſe which follow, might profitably have been omitted.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, where you ſay in the firſt Section, <q>That all they who are effectually called, and regenerated, have a new heart and a new ſpirit created in them;</q> whereas many are called and that earneſtly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually on the Lords part, as we have ſhewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lready, who admitt of no change of will, and affections through their own obſtinacy: and though all that are truly changed, receive at the firſt a new frame of heart, will, and diſpoſition, yet they do not by and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a new heart and a new Spirit in the ſenſe of the holy Prophets: for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhewes, That not onely clean water muſt be poured down upon us, but that we muſt be cleanſed from all our filthineſs, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, before we can have a new heart and a new ſpirit created in us, nor is the ſtony heart wholly taken from us, and an heart of fleſh wholly given unto us till then; But this is the peculiar eſtate of ſuch Saints or ſanctified ones as have attained the third and laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of regeneration, when Chriſt according to the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115397:103"/>ſpirit is riſen up in them, as we ſhewed before. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. Of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> See <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.3, 4, 5, of thoſe to whom the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay, <q>That ſuch perſons are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified through the vertue of Chriſts death;</q> it is another great miſtake; for though the vertue of his death is great, and of ineſtimable value to take away the guilt of ſin, and remove the curſe from us, as we have ſaid before, yet we read nowhere of any power proceeding from thence, in the mortifying of ſin, though that his ſuffering ſhould be both a patern, and a motive to follow him in his like death, as hath been ſaid. Yea, the Apoſtle aſcribes weakneſs, and not power to Chriſt in his death, as that whereby he could properly ſuffer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 4. <hi>For though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God. It was power indeed whereby he was raiſed up.</hi> Rom. 1.4. <hi>And it is through the ſame power, that thoſe who are dead with him, muſt be raiſed up again.</hi> Phil. 3.10. <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So then there is expreſs mention in the word, of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or power of his reſurrection to be imployed in this work of our regeneration, but none of the power or efficacy of his death; yea, that benefit which we have by the death of Chriſt followes the work of ſanctification in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and doth not go before it, as hath been proved ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas you ſay, or imply, <q>That the whole dominion of ſin, is deſtroyed in thoſe that are in any meaſure called and ſanctified,</q> it is a thing rather to be wiſhed, if it were the will of God, then to be granted for truth; for we find the contrary in our own experience while we are babes in Chriſt; yea, the Apoſtle deſcribing the eſtate of ſuch in his own perſon, (becauſe he had been formerly in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtate) complaineth grievouſly of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining and dominion of corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. <hi>But I ſee another law in my members rebeiling againſt the Law of my minde, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of ſin. Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115397:104"/>death!</hi> indeed if you had ſaid that the former love which the leaſt of Saints had to the body of ſin, and their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubjection thereunto is in ſome meaſure deſtroyed, you had ſpoken truly; but is not a dominion againſt their wils, a dominion ſtill? Yea, it is the moſt grievious tyranny of all other, and the hardeſt to be born. So then there is left in all the regenerate a dominion and tyranny of ſin, till by grace they obtain power, and victory againſt it, though this dominion is now <hi>invitum imperium,</hi> and not ſo dangerous as it was in the time of their voluntary ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That which you ſpeak in the cloſe of that Section, is true, or falſe, as men beſtir themſelves in reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, and ſeeking Gods grace there againſt, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neglect thoſe duties; to wit, <q>That the ſeveral luſts of this body of ſin are more and more weakned, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and they more and more quickned and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all ſaving graces to the practiſe of true holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your ſecond Section preſents but one error upon the matter; but it is a material one; to wit, <q>That our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in this life is always imperfect, and that there abide ſome remnants of corruption in every part;</q> that hence ariſeth a continual and irreconcileable war, the fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. But brethren if our ſanctification muſt not be perfected here; when or where muſt it be made up? Is not this life the time of our regeneration? <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>For the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope, and that glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Muſt ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill remain in every part? Why ſo, hath God ſuch pleaſure in it? Shall Chriſt loſe the end of his comming, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the next verſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 27. of which we ſpake before.</p>
                  <p>And though while the fleſh, and the ſpirit continue,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115397:104"/>there remains an irreconcileable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But we muſt pardon you, for in your third Section you ſeem to contradict all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſaying, <q>In which war although the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruption for a time may much prevaile, yet through the continual ſupply of ſtrength from the ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt, the regenerate part doth overcome; and ſo the Saints grow in grace, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſs in the fear of God;</q> but concerning this we muſt refer you to what we ſpake before upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Surely as God cauſed his word to be written that we might there through become abſolute, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 16, 17. And hath given gifts from heaven unto his Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Teachers to bring us unto ſuch a ſtature of perfection in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So he praying for the perfecting of the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. did pray for things feaſible; and attainable, nor can the prayer of Chriſt for the ſame thing be irritous, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi>

                  <p>But the things we moſt wonder at are theſe; Firſt, That you ſhould now come to ſpeak of faith, not onely after effectual calling, which in your ſenſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies faith, but after juſtification, which you confeſs to be attained by faith; yea, and after ſanctification al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, (which though you take it to be a diſtinct thing from juſtification) muſt for the greateſt part follow faith alſo as an effect of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Among them that are juſtified by faith that is in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Secondly, That you ſhould make no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the three degrees, if not kindes of ſaving faith; to wit, <hi>Faith in God the father, Belief in God the Son, and Confidence in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The which as they are in part deſcriminated from each other, at leaſt wiſe by their diſtinct objects in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115397:106"/>Apoſtles Creed, ſo are they clearly diſſevered from each other in the holy Scripture; It is in a general comprehenſion, that the Apoſtle takes the faith of the elect, when he deſcribes it to be an acknowledgment of the truth that is according to godlineſs, in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began; 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>But it is faith in God the Father,</hi> or faith <hi>in confuſo,</hi> as we ſaid before, that is ſet forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>For he that cometh to God, muſt beleeve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him;</hi> as it is faith in God the Son, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> points at <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15, 16. ſaying, <hi>We who are Jewes by nature, and not finners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have beleeved in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the faith of Jeſus.</hi> It is alſo that faith in the holy Ghoſt of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>For we through the ſpirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by faith; that is the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> or the <hi>beavenly Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 33.16. Theſe three are diſtinct from each other, and men may have the firſt without the ſecond, and the firſt and ſecond without the third.</p>
                  <p>For firſt we finde, that <hi>Cornelius beleeved in God, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, gave alms, and did many things with acceptance before God,</hi> ere ever he was commanded to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> that he might by him hear of the faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus our Saviour ſpeaks to his Diſciples and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>John</hi> 14.1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled; ye beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me;</hi> intimating that though they had a clear and ſtrong faith in God the Father, yet their knowledge of him in his right ſaving office, and their reſpective faith was but darke and weak as yet; for they neither diſtinctly underſtood, that he muſt dye for them, and that they muſt dye with him, if they ſhould be ſaved, nor expected ſalvation from ſins and Satan by his blood and ſpirit; and much leſs had they any hope or due knowledge of the promiſed Spirit,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115397:107"/>the everlaſting comforter, who ſhould abide with them for ever, till Chriſt there, &amp; eſpecially after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction revealed the ſame unto them, and brought them to a true belief and ſtedfaſt hope of the ſame; yea, where are they now to be found, who thus beleeve in the holy Ghoſt, or in Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, for a right ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and ſpiritual ſalvation, from the hands of all their enemies by his alone power and grace?</p>
                  <p>Thus is that fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>And ſhall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night;</hi> to wit, for help againſt their ſpiritual enemies; <hi>I tell you that he will avenge them ſpeedily; nevertheleſs when the Son of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhall he finde faith upon the earth?</hi> This faith was a rare bird, like a black Swan at Chriſts laſt comming in the Spirit. That there may be ſome pious ſouls which not onely want the third degree or kinde of faith, but have not ſo much as heard that there is an holy Ghoſt, the Scriptures witneſs clearly. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2. The like may be ſaid concerning the Lord Jeſus and faith in him, among the Heathen to whom the Father hath not revealed him as yet.</p>
                  <p>But now to come to your particular Sections; In the firſt of them you ſay, <q>That faith whereby the Elect beleeve, to the ſaving of their ſouls, is the work of the ſpirit of Chriſt:</q> which thing in a proper and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate kinke of ſpeaking, is not true; for it is the work of the Father to reveale and manifeſt the Son un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as it is the work of the Father and Son to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith in the holy Ghoſt; Thus ſpeaks our Saviour to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had through faith confeſſed him to be the Son of God. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Bleſſed art thou Bar</hi>-Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, <hi>for fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> It is the Father that muſt draw us unto the Son, to ſeek and expect redemption internal and external from him, <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45, 46.

                  <p>And ſecondly, He is the fulfiller of our faith, or of that which we by our like faith, while we follow him in the ſame race, expect from him according to the promiſes; But whether the firſt word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>That alſo which follows in the ſame Section muſt be underſtood of ſuch a miniſtry as is called and enabled by the Lord for that work, and of prayer made with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and affection, for the increaſe of that grace; where you ſay, <q>That Faith is ordinarily wrought by the miniſtry of the word, by which alſo, and by the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and prayer, it is increaſed and ſtrengthened;</q> for ſuch Miniſters as teach vain Doctrine, and adminiſter the Sacraments with ignorance, and errour, beget an anſwerable faith, and perſwaſion in their hearers, who give ear and credit unto them; as your Authors and Teachers have done in ſome of you; but this muſt here alſo be remembred, that the Lord can, and often doth when and where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth beget faith, even faith in Jeſus Chriſt by the ſole illumination, and teaching of the holy Ghoſt, as he did in <hi>Job</hi> among the Heathen, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26. and in <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſdom, and to another the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the ſame Spirit, to another faith by the ſame Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. And for this work ſake he is called the Spirit of faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>In your 2. Section you confirm, what we ſaid before of hiſtorical faith, that it is an ingredient into true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, where you ſay, 'By this a Chriſtian beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be true, whatſoever is revealed in the word,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115397:108"/>you mean ſo far as men are enlightned to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, otherwiſe there is more repeated in the word then moſt men do, or can underſtand while they are in the ſtate of Faith; but here you ſhould have added this alſo to your former words; that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of God beleeve alſo whatſoever God is pleaſed to reveale unto them, beſides the word; which yet is not contrary to the word.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> beleeved that which God had ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, concerning the preſervation of himſelf, and thoſe that were with him in the ſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.25. And St. <hi>John</hi> gave reſpect and credit unto all that was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him in the Revelation, where by the way you may obſerve how God is the Author of Faith; to wit, by revealing his ſaving counſel, and will unto us, which by nature, and much more in our corrupt eſtate we are in a great meaſure ignorant of; And how far faith lies in our own hand, and power, <hi>viz.</hi> onely to aſſent unto that which is ſo revealed, and made known out of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thus there is an aſſenting, or diſſenting faculty in all men. See <hi>Acts</hi> 9.29. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106 12. <hi>Then beleeved they his word and ſang his praiſe,</hi> with verſe 24. Yea, <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the pleaſant Land, they beleeved not his Word,</hi> Acts 17.4. <hi>And ſome of them beleeved, and conſorted with</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas. verſe 5. <hi>But the Jewes which beleeved not were moved mith envy,</hi> &amp;c. John 3.32, 33. <hi>And what be hath ſeen, and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiveth his teſtimony, be that receiveth his teſtimony hath ſet to his ſeal that God is true;</hi> And accordingly as men ſtand affected to the perſon reporting, or the thing revealed, ſo are they apt to credit or diſcredit the ſame, <hi>Facilè e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115397:108"/>to their ſins, ſelf-wiſdom, and falſe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, beleeved not, but contradicted, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.44, 45, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it is alſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods grace was made known unto men, they were commanded to repent, and believe the Goſpel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. And that others are complained of for their unbelief, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 4.2. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preached, as well as unto them, but the word preached did not profit them, being not mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> For the Lord never requires more then either by his preventing, or aſſiſting grace men can perform, nor yet complaines of them, but where they are ſome wayes deficient in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their part.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What you there ſpeak of faith's different actings in relation to the commands, promiſes, and threatnings, recorded in the word, is true alſo as to the inhibitions and narrations found there; but herein you are defective.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in not declaring by what form, or vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple faith becomes ſo active; to wit, by love <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> 5.6. <hi>Without which, faith is dead, James</hi> 2.14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, In paſſing over the acts and offices of faith in God the Father, and of faith in the Holy Ghoſt, both which have an eye to ſanctification, and eternal life as well as faith in Chriſt, though this laſt named ſeeks that which we called juſtification more eſpecially from Chriſt. But if Gods eternal decree be ſo abſolute as you ſpeak of before; what need is there that ſaith ſhould be moved with threatnings, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?</p>
                  <p>For your third, and laſt Section; It may be wholly admitted with this caution: That faith at length gets the victory, and growes up to a full aſſurance, if men perſevere in love, and obedience to God, and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek that victory, and the aſſurance alſo from the Lord, and his power. But both time, and the uſe of all good means are required thereunto; and as faith
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115397:109"/>is weak in its firſt beginning, ſo when it hath gotten ſome ſtrength, yet by neglect of the means aforeſaid, and by wilful diſobedience, it may not onely be much weakned, but wholy loſt, as we ſee in the parable of the Sower, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Yea, the Apoſte tells not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>women that had forſaken their firſt faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.12. <hi>But of men alſo who by putting away a good conſcience, have made ſhipwrack of their faith,</hi> as we ſaid before, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18, 19. How Chriſt may be ſaid to be the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of our faith, we ſhewed before.</p>

                  <p>In your firſt Section you call this repentance unto life, whereof you ſpeak, an Evangelical grace, as if you thought it to be a ſingle vertue, as hope, patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or the like: But repentance in the latitude is an univerſal change of the inward man, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Secondly, Though in your ſecond Section you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr with us in making repentance, ſuch an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal change of the whole man, as that he not only grieves for, hates, and turnes from all his ſins unto God, but alſo both purpoſeth, and indeavors to walk with him in all the wayes of his commandements; yet here, you faile, or miſtake in three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In deſcribing ſuch a repentance only as the leaſt Saint attaines by the work of the Father, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out that repentance unto life, which lies in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. where it is ſaid, <hi>If yee live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if through the Spirit yee mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, then ye ſhall live,</hi> and to that effect. Ezek. 18.31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a now heart, and and a new Spirit, for why will you dye O houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In ſaying here that it is upon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods mercy in Chriſt, to ſuch as are peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that men ſo grieve for ſin, hate and turn from it; and ſo purpoſe, and ind avor to keep all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: whereas the apprehenſion of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace in the general, and that for ſalvation, may produce all this, and hath done it in thouſands of Jews and Gentiles in the times of the Old Teſtament, and ſince alſo, who for the preſent had no knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and the further grace to be attained in him; yet do we not deny but the knowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of that grace which is held forth in Chriſt, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that godly ſorrow, and much ſtrengthen that purpoſe, and endevor of obedience, yea and make the believer to ſeek the ſecond part of repentance, even the work of mortification from the grace of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you are ſhort in this that you make this ſaving
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115397:112"/>repentance to extend no further, then to bare purpoſe, &amp; indeavor of walking with God in the ways aforeſaid; For if this indeavor acts but according to the ſtrength of nature, or the firſt grace received, it muſt needs fall ſhort both in the ſubduing of ſin, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods will; and therefore true repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, ſeeks grace, and power from Chriſt for both, out of faith in the promiſes, and reſts not till it hath attained it according to the promiſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27, &amp;c. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.33, 34. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you ſtrangely contradict your ſelves in ſaying, firſt, That repentance is no cauſe of the pardon of ſin, and yet afterwards making it a thing ſo neceſſary for ſinners, that none may expect pardon without; Is <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> no cauſe with you? or is the fulfilling of ſuch a condition as without which remiſſion of ſins, ſhall not be granted, a thing of no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at all to him that requireth it abſolutely though he help us in it? Or is it in no wiſe to be reſted in, as any ſatisfation to God who requires it? We grant it is not the firſt inducing cauſe, nor yet the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, but is firſt, or laſt ſome antecedent cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing ſhall be eſtated, and ſealed upon him that is to enjoy it, eſpecially ſince it is Gods abſolute will and pleaſure to grant pardon no other way.</p>
                  <p>That alſo which you affirm in your fourth Section, is by ſome queſtioned, and that not without cauſe. Whether there be not ſome ſin ſo great, that it doth, and ſhall bring damnation with it though it be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: For there is a time of patience and mercy, in which God hath purpoſed to receive the ſinner, if he repents, and returns, Rev. 2.21. <hi>And I gave her ſpace to repent of her fornications, but ſhe repented not.</hi> If in this tearm or ſpace they repent not, they may, yea ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from pardon, though they repent afterwards, Luk. 13.25, 26. <hi>When once the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up and hath ſhut to the door, and you begin to ſtand without, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115397:112"/>to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord open unto us, he ſhall anſwer, and ſhall ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are;</hi> what ſay you to <hi>Judas</hi> who repented all too late, as many thouſands more do, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28.29.</p>
                  <p>Your fifth Section we grant, as alſo the neceſſity of confeſſing of ſins unto God, and in caſe of ſcandal given to the reſpective parties ſcandalized alſo, Section ſixth. But here again you are defective in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that you ſet not forth the expedience, yea neceſſity, that there may be for ſuch as are troubled in minde, either for ſome great ſin committed, or with terrible temptations, to confeſs, and open their eſtate to ſome wiſe, and godly counſellor, whether Miniſter, or private Saint, and to crave the help of their adviſe, and prayers.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, you make no mention of reſtitution, which is requiſite alſo in many caſes, if the party be able to recompence the damage, which he hath done, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1, <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 19.8.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter of good works is none of your worſt labors in this tractate, yet is your doctrine therein like the good works you deſcribe, ſhort and imperfect.</p>
                  <p>In your firſt Section you affirm that good works are only ſuch as God hath commanded in his word, which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch as are ordinarily to be performed, or elſe your affirmation is not true, for many good works have been done by inſtinct only of Gods Spirit, as the anointing of our Saviour, with that pretious oyntment before hand to his burial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.7; 8, 9, 10. which yet are not contrary to what is commanded in the word: The obedience of <hi>Moſes, Gideon,</hi> and divers other perſons, who had immndiate, and extraordinary callings, to do this or that ſervice, was a good work alſo, and commanded by God, but not in his written word before extant; yet every good work muſt have a warrant from God for the doing of it, Nor can men have a better warrant for all ordinary works then the writen word, and therefore you juſtly there reject all works deviſed by men out of blind zeal upon what pretence ſoever of good intention, but we fear it will finde your ſelves faulty: how much more then are thoſe works to be here excluded, which men work through the inſtigation and illuſions of Satan?</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section, beſides that you leave out our love to God and men, whereof good works are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115397:115"/>evidences as well as of a true, and lively faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>You affirm that all believers are the workmanſhip of God, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which is true of all men in general according to our firſt creation, but of none in the way of regeneration; but of ſuch Saints onely as both actually believe in Chriſt, and are in ſome meaſure renewed in him, for the Saints in God the Father are not yet come ſo far.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section, You affirm three things which are yet more ſtrange, not only to us, but to truth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <q>That the ability of the Saints to do good works;</q> is not at all of or from themſelves? how then are they workers together with God, and with his grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. For though the power whereby they work is principally the Lords, yet our joynt endeavors, and power are not excluded, 1 <hi>Corinthans</hi> 15.10. <hi>But I labored more then they all, yet not I but the grace of God which was with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That you ſeem to bereave men of the uſe of their wils, not onely before, but after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, in that you make the grace which the Saints have received already, to be vain, impotent, and uſeleſs: where you ſay, And that they may be enabled thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> to do good works, beſides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the ſame holy Spirit to work in them, to will, and to do of his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>We grant that in thoſe works wherein the temptation of the enemy oppoſeth it ſelf in power, ſuch an influence is needful but not uſually elſewhere; yea thoſe that are filled with the holy Ghoſt from heaven, and to whom the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed kingdom is come in power, ſeem to need no other influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all, for that ſpirit leads them into all truth, and acts them continually.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section you do not only derogate from the chief Saints, but from the grace and power of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in them, in two falſe affirmations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:115397:115"/>Firſt, In ſaying, <q>That they who in their obedience attain unto the greateſt height which is poſſible in this life, cannot ſupererrogate, or do more then God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: For did not St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach the Goſpel of grace,</q> which was no where commanded? 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 9.1—15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In maintaining that they fell much ſhort of what in duty they are bound to do; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood of the Saints in their minority, and growing up, is true, but not of the Elect Saints, or ſuch as are perfected in Chriſt Jeſus; doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>That he was able to do all things through Chriſt who ſtrengthned him. Phil.</hi> 4.13. Why doth holy <hi>Epaphras</hi> by the teſtimony of the Apoſtle pray for the <hi>Colloſſians; That they might ſtand perfect and compleat in all the will of God, Col.</hi> 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>2. if any ſuch thing be attainable? Yea, Chriſt himſelf ſhews that we may do all that which is commanded us, though we are to God unprofitable ſervants when we have ſo done, not adding any thing to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. It was one main end of Chriſts coming as we ſhewed before; <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, which walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. then the thing muſt needs be attainable.</p>
                  <p>In your Fifth Section, as you truely affirm, <q>That we cannot by our beſt works merit pardon of ſin, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life,</q> at the hand of God, for many reaſons which you there alledge, ſo in the cloſe of that Section you utter ſome untruths; <q>As that all the works even of the beſt Saints, as they proceed from themſelves, are defiled, and mixed with much weakneſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and that they cannot endure the ſeverity of Gods judgements;</q> for doth the Lord any where require more of his Saints then to love him, with all their heart, and with all their ſouls; and ſo much we finde promiſed to all that truly return unto God, if they have faith and will to ſeek it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>And
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115397:116"/>the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul that thou mayeſt live.</hi> Yea, doth not the Apoſtle expreſſely tell us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. <hi>That herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world:</hi> Defend the honour of God then according to the truth, and take not from the glorious works of Chriſt, whereby the Father is glorified, upon pretence of giving glory to the Father. Remember what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chapter</hi> 13.7. <hi>Will ye ſpeak wickedly for God? Will ye talk deceitfully for him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In your ſixth Sextion, as you ſpeak comfortably to the young beleevers in Chriſt, who are conſtant in their good willing indeavours, that their good works are acceptable to God in Chriſt, though for the preſent they are not wholy unblamable; and do truely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <q>That the Lord is pleaſed to reward alſo that which is ſincere in them, though accompanied with many weakneſſes and imperfections;</q> yet your ſayings in that Section are ſo accompanied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that you ſpeak that the works of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are accepted for their perſons, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof may be truly aſſerted, that the perſons are accepted for their works wrought in them by Chriſt. Revelations 3.8. <hi>I know thy works; behold I have ſet before thee an open door, and no man ſhall ſhut it; for thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word, and haſt not denyed my name.</hi> And verſe 10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept my word, I will alſo keep thee from the hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which ſhall come upon all the world, to try then that dwell upon Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that you ſay, <q>That the workes of the beſt grown Saints in this life, are not wholy unblameable, and unreproveable in the ſight of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:115397:116"/>Thirdly, In your affirmation, <q>That the unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect workes of the Saints are accepted in Chriſt, though they remain ſuch all our life long;</q> which is not true, of thoſe who have both time and means to aime at perfection it ſelf, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. with <hi>Hebrews</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.8 9.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas you imply, <q>That bare ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will carry out the Saints, though they remain imperfect in their obedience all their life long;</q> it is a great miſtake, for the Lord requires growth anſwerable unto the grace, means, and ſpace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto men, even of them who are ſincere alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.22. <hi>Seeing you have purified your ſoules in obeying the truth,</hi> (<hi>under the obedience of Love,</hi> ſaith the old Latine Tranſlation) <hi>to the unfeined love of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; ſee that ye love one another, with a pure heart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as you have here, and elſewhere weakened the hands of the regenerate, in the work of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their obedience and good workes; ſo you have animated the unregenerate in their way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is good in your ſeventh and laſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; where you ſay, and that truely. <q>That the neglect of what they can do in this kinde, is more ſinful, and diſpleaſing to God, then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch things which for matter are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word;</q> where by the way you hint what are the requiſite things which ſhould concur to the making up of a good work, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have the word for their rule, faith for their efficient, a purified heart for their fountain, the Glory of God for their end; where onely your main ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient is wanting, the ſpirit, and power of God.</p>
                  <p>Yet thus much we muſt advertiſe you of, that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115397:117"/>many of thoſe whom you account to be moral men, and Heathens, do act out of Conſcience, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and the grace of regeneration alſo, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimilech</hi> ſeems to have done, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 20.1.6. <hi>Job, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi> the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and others did.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erſeverance follows good works here in due order; for it is in them that the Saints muſt perſevere: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we finde in you a conſtancy which we cannot commend, for you perſiſt in doctrine, tending to ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>In your third chapter of Gods eternal decree, you make ſome preſume, and others to deſpair, teaching that Gods decree of life, and death, is both particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and abſolute.</p>
                  <p>In your ninth, and tenth chapters, you make men ſtupid by denying us al uſe of our wils, and ſetting forth Gods work to be irreſiſtable in our firſt converſion; and here you ſow pillows under mens arm-holes, in ſaying, <q>That true converts cannot poſſibly fall away from grace.</q> We grant indeed that this controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115397:118"/>the perſeverance of the Saints, without greater light then for a long time appeared in the world, was not like to be decided in haſt: for it was not onely agitated betwixt Proteſtants and Papiſts, but with inteſtine debate by the deſſenting Doctors of each Church, and that with ſeeming evidence of Scriptures on both ſides; So that great need there was of a Moderator to be ſent from Heaven for the compoſing of this, and manifold other moſt intricate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies beſides; by reaſon of the returning darkneſs which after the Apoſtacy from the faith, had overſpread the Churches, each ſide alſo haling the Scriptures, <hi>velut ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torto collo,</hi> to plead their cauſe: Howbeit if our eyes had not been holden, we might eaſily have obſerved that the Scriptures do diſtinguiſh both the Saints, and their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and that as ſome of thoſe prerogatives are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, and ſuch is a poſſibility of not falling away from God, totally, and finally, if they continue ſtedfaſt in their faith and obedience, or after ſome ſlips riſe up by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. So ſome others are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Saints of the third form, who have followed Chriſt both unto his death, and reſurrection, and ſuch is the prerogative of final perſeverance, or of impoſſibility to be deceived, or ſeduced, <hi>Mot.</hi> 24.24. And though God is conſtant in his love, and aſſiſtance of grace; yet even his called ones may by their inconſtancy, and wilful revolt from him, alienate his heart from them irrecoverably, as <hi>David</hi> well knew, and warned his <hi>Solomon</hi> accordingly, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.9. So true is that which the Prophet <hi>Azariah</hi> ſpake to <hi>Aſa</hi> and his people, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15 2. <hi>Hear ye me</hi> Aſa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>the Lord is with you, while you be with him, if you ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if you forſake him he will forſake you.</hi> There is indeed a Covenant made with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed of conſtant continual, and everlaſting mercy, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89.28, 37.

                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:115397:119"/>But now to take a ſurvey of your particular Sections: In the very entrance of the firſt, you ſhew that blindneſs is broken in upon the Churches.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that you ſet Gods accepting of us in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, before effectual calling, as precedent whether in time, or eternity; to which laſt you incline: whereas we are made accepted in his beloved Son, after we are called, and brought to obey him; yea in ſome manner ſanctified by him, and not before.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, In that you affirm of all the called ones and Saints in general, that they ſhall certainly perſevere to the end, contrary to many expreſs Scriptures, ſome whereof were before produced.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that of the <hi>unclean ſpirit, which with ſet on worſe then himſelf, returned to his old houſe again,</hi> Mat. 12.43, 44, 45. And that Rom. 11, 22. <hi>Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God on them that fell ſeverity, but towards thee good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> That 1 Tim. 1.19. <hi>Holding faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which ſome having put away, concerning faith have made ſhipwrack.</hi> That of 1 Tim. 5.12. <hi>Having damnation becauſe they have forſaken their firſt faith,</hi> and verſe 15. <hi>For ſome are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready turned aſide after Satan.</hi> See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Heb</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Nor can theſe places following be fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the worlds end, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſs, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live?</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10.26, 27, 18. <hi>for if we ſin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fiery indignation which ſhall devour the adverſaries;</hi> He that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, dyed without mercy under two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he then be thought worthy that hath troden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and hath done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace. See
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115397:119"/>
                     <hi>verſe</hi> 39. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>Jude</hi> verſe 12. Revel. 3.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section, almoſt every aſſertion is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and falſe as followes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you ſay, but moſt untruly, <q>That the Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance depends not at all upon their free will:</q> For did not Chriſt himſelf after ſome of his former Diſciples were departed from him, ask the twelve Apoſtles, <hi>Will ye alſo go away,</hi> Joh. 6.27. Intimating that he holds no man againſt his, but they by the abuſe of their free will might uncompelledly leave him, yet at their own peril, as <hi>Judas,</hi> one of them afterwards did; what was the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Peter</hi> in his fall was pittyed, and by our Saviour not only prayed for, but holpen up again, but becauſe he was conſtant in his good will, as our Saviour teſtifies of him, and ſome others with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.45. <hi>The ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <q>That the perſeverance of the Saints depends upon the immutability of the decree of Gods election,</q> whereas we have proved before, that Gods general electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man is conditional; and as for his ſpecial election, it depends upon foreſeen perſeverance, and not perſeverance upon it, and ſo doth Gods laſt, and finall election, as we ſhewed before alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <q>That this perſeverance depends upon the unchangeable love of God;</q> which as we have ſhewed, may by our unworthineſs, unthankfulneſs, and Apoſtacy be changed into wrath, yea hatred, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.19. <hi>And when the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking of his Sons, and of his daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you ſay, <q>It depends upon the efficacy of the merit,</q> and interceſſion of Chriſt; but he makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for none to obtain the Grace of perſeverance, but ſuch as continue ſtedfaſt in their good will which they had to the Father, and him; as we ſee he prayed not for the Apoſtate <hi>Judas, Jo.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10. Although he with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral interceſſion prayed for the unregenerate, even for his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115397:120"/>enemies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. and taught us by his Apoſtles to pray for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly you ſay truly, "It depends upon the abiding of the Spirit in us: But doth not that abode of the Spirit, depend upon our conſtancy in faith and good will, and upon our giving ear to it, when after our fals, and ſlips, it reproves, admoniſheth, and teacheth us anew. Hence we are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to <hi>grieve the Holy Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>Leaſt he ſhould depart,</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>Now the Juſt ſhall live by faith, but if any man draw back my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly you ſay, "It depends upon the ſeed of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in us, but that ſeed remaines in none unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably, but thoſe which are born again in Chriſt after the Spirit, or the Saints of the third form and order, of whom it is ſaid peculiarly, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That they cannot ſin.</hi> For all other Saints thoſe of the ſecond form, Saints and believers in Chriſt, which are not yet dead, and made alive again with him, may and do ſin as well, though not ſo often, as the Saints of the firſt form, or the fathers new begotten ones.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly you ſay here, <q>That this certainty of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance depends upon the nature of the covenant of grace,</q> of which there are two parts, the one promiſeth cleanſing grace in and through the blood, and Spirit of Chriſt; the other a ſtedfaſt, and immoveable kingdom, to thoſe that are ſo cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>See for the firſt, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.32, 33, 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the others, <hi>Jere.</hi> 32.40. but all this is promiſed conditionally to thoſe that believe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. to ſuch as perſevere unto the end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13. and to him that overcometh, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.12. So that the ſtedfaſt eſtate and kingdom which cannot be ſhaken depends upon perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances in mortification, and our immoveable eſtate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receiving of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Yet do we not deny but that the perſeverance of the Saints whereby, they continue in the following of Chriſt unto their death, and their infallible eſtate from which they cannot afterwards poſſibly fall away, hath very great
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115397:120"/>dependance upon all the things by you named, but in ſuch manner as we have ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>In your third and laſt Section, you erre firſt on the one hand, and then on the other.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <q>Whereas you aſcribe unto all the Saints upon earth promiſcuouſly a poſſibility of falling into greivous ſins by temptations from Satan, and the world, the prevalency of remaining corruption, and neglect of the means of their preſervation, whereby they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur Gods diſpleaſure, grieve his Spirit, ſuffer ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of their graces, and comforts, harden their hearts, wound their conſciences, hurt and ſcandalize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and bring temporal judgements upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſay, That the Saints in the Holy Ghoſt that are riſen again with Chriſt, are paſt all this, 2 Cor. 5.12. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new,</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>He that is born of God doth not commit ſin, but his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> See Revel. 2.17, 26, 27. Revel. 3.9, 10, 11, 12. Revel. 7.14, 15, 16, 17. Revel. 21.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>And I heard a great voice from heaven, ſaying, Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be any pain (to wit ſpiritual pain) for the former things are paſſed away.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N your title or inſcription of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have joyned two things together which are not alwayes inſeparable. For the aſſurance of Grace for the preſent, may be without certainty of ſalvation, for the future, but the infallibility of the laſt alwayes preſuppoſeth the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115397:123"/>Here we cannot but commend your method, for the aſſurance of Salvation hath ſuch cloſe and immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon perſeverance in obedience, and grace, that that where the former is but conditional, and poſſible, this latter is ſo likewiſe; but where the other is certain, this follows it in infallibility.</p>
                  <p>And hence it will neceſſarily follow, that wherein you were miſtaken in the former; you muſt unavoidably err in this latter: how be it many things which you here ſet forth have good aſſurance of truth, as thoſe things in your firſt Section.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themſelves with falſe hopes, and carnal preſumptions of being in the favor of God, and eſtate of ſalvation,</q> and that the hope of ſuch ſhall periſh; But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we pray you, that as privy hypocrites can have no ſuch hopes; ſo ſome which take themſelves to be no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites (becauſe they ſerve God in outward duty and forms, yet are ſtrangers to the wayes of everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) will be found in this number of vaine hopes at the laſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>Luke.</hi> 13.25, 26.27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p>It is true alſo which you there ſay in the next place of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, <q>That ſuch as truly believe in Chriſt (which are onely they that ſeek ſanctification from him, to make them new creatures, as well as deliverance from hell, or an outward happineſs in heaven) and love him in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, endeavoring to walk in all good conſcience before him, may in this life be certainly aſſured that they are in the ſtate of grace, yea that ſuch alſo may rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</q> but where you add in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In your ſecond Section you ſay, <q>That the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of hope is founded.</q>

                  <p>Secondly upon the inward evidence of theſe graces (you ſhould have ſaid thoſe conditions) unto which the promiſes are made.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly upon the <hi>witneſſing of the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But mark here we pray you firſt, that while the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the promiſes, are but a fulfilling, and not fully performed, our hopes, and aſſurances are but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.</p>
                  <p>And 2. that as the ſpirit of Adoption is given us, but conditionally at the firſt, ſo it beareth witneſs with our ſpirit accordingly, ſpeaking peace while we carry our ſelves as children, reproving us when we rebel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from us when we remain incorrigible, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8, 9, 10 <hi>For he ſaid ſurely they are my people, children that will not err, ſo he was their Saviour, In all their affliction he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, in his love, and in his pitty he redeeemed them, he hare them and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed them all the dayes of old. But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemie, and be fought againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea the Apoſtle in the ſame place where he ſpeaks of our Adoption, and the Spirit of Adoption bearing witneſs with our ſpirits, declares that at the firſt it is but a conditionall eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16; 17. as we ſhewed before; <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. The ſame we likewiſe ſpake concerning the earneſt of the ſpirit, whereby we are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115397:124"/>ſealed unto the day of redemption; for as ſome Deeds are fealed only as skrols, to confirm a bargain when conditions are performed, ſo it is with the earneſt, and firſt ſealing of the ſpirit, but when the conditions are fulfilled in our dying with Chriſt, then the ſpirit ſeales men finally and abſolutely, and becomes the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed comforter, which ſhall abide with the Saints for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. 2 <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Jo.</hi> 7, 38, 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.17.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you ſay truly, <q>That this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſurance doth not belong to the eſſence of faith;</q> where we will be bold to add, <hi>that it pertaineth not to faith, but is an eſtate, which comes after that ſaith in Chriſt hath done its office in purifying our hearts from ſin, and not before:</hi> Yet may a conditional hope, yea aſſurance be attained bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And how much more will your former doctrine which in this behalf we blamed do it, by naturall conſequences, if Gods grace interpoſe not to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:115397:124"/>As to your laſt Section, we grant that the inchoated, and conditional aſſurance of believers may be either ſhaken, and diminiſhed, or afterwards being taken in due time, may be recovered, and revived by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective means, which you here ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>Yea whatſoever you here ſurmiſe to the contrary, as we have proved, it may be finally, and irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loſt, by ſecurity, preſumptuous rebellions, finall and total Apoſtacy. See 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>Look to your ſelves that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought,</hi> Rev. 3.11. <hi>Hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the abſolute and final aſſurance of which we ſpeak, is neither ſubject to ſhaking, nor any diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and much leſs to a total and finall amiſſion; as the place before cited proves.</p>
                  <p>For when a man attaines to that eſtate, his ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and can never be loſt, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.

                  <p>And this we muſt do not by ſearching out certain markes, and tokens, which proves us to be in ſome eſtate of grace, but by adding vertue to vertue, and a ſpiritual progreſs even to the end, 2 Peter 15, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Wherefore adde unto your faith, vertue, and to vertue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to patienece godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly kindneſss, and to brotherly kindneſs, love,</hi> where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruth it ſelf hath no ſuch cauſe to wage Law with you here as elſwhere, moſt of thoſe things which you have here ſet forth, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moral law being legal, juſt, and true (though herein you contradict your ſelves in other places) yet you have here and there your illegali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and miſtakes alſo in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In your firſt Section you truly ſay, <q>That God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity, ſuch a Law, and covenant of works as you deſcribe, with power and ability to keep it:</q> And is he not the ſame God ſtill in wiſdom, mercy and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; requiring nothing at any mans hand, but what he will enable him to doe by his preventing or aſſiſting grace, if hee ſeek it?</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section you ſay, and that truly, <q>That the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> being the ſame in effect with the Moral! Law delivered upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> continued to be a perfect rule of Righteouſneſſe:</q> Nor muſt the Iſrael of God think to obtrude upon the Lord any other accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble righteouſneſſe for ever, then is therein required and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.24, 25. <hi>And the Lord commanded us to doe all theſe ſtatutes, to fear the Lord our God for our good alwayes, that he might preſerve us alive as it is this day. And it ſhall be our righteouſneſs if we obſerve to doe all theſe Commandments before The Lord our God, as he hath commanded us:</hi> Pſalm 119.144. <hi>the righteouſneſſe of his teſtimonies is everlaſting:</hi> For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of which righteouſneſſe, becauſe it was become impoſſible to the fallen Man, Chriſt is freely beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. And ſo it is the end and drift of the law
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115397:127"/>to ſend us unto Chriſt, to ſeek our power, wiſdom and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes from him; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>But whereas you ſay in the end of that Section, <q>That the four firſt Commandments contain our duty toward God;</q> and the ſix laſt our duty to Man: Perhaps it will prove a diſtribution more common then ſound. For as the whole Law is ſpirituall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. ſo it ſeems firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire duty toward God in all the ten Commandments, and then to call for Service toward men in the ſecond place.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt four Commandments (which St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſome of the Ancients reduce to three only) your ſelves doe not deny it; Let us then take a view of the reſt. Doth not the fifth Commandment enjoyn us firſt of all to honour our heavenly Father; and the Wiſdom, or <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> from above, our ſpirituall Mother; 1 Sam. 2.20. <hi>For them that honour me, I will honour;</hi> Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I then be a Father, where is mine honour?</hi> Matth. 11.19. <hi>But Wiſdome is juſtified of her children,</hi> ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 7.35. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>But Jeruſalem which is from above is free, which is the Mother of us all,</hi> Prov. 7.4. <hi>Say unto Wiſdom thou art my Siſter, and call underſtanding thy Kinſwoman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doth not the ſixth Commandement forbid ſpiritual murther in the firſt place, to wit the killing of Chriſt, the quenching of the Spirit, and the deſtroying of the inward meſſengers, and motions? <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Ye have condemned, and killed the juſt one, and he reſiſteth you not,</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> Thus the Apoſtles complaines of the Apoſtates that they crucifie afreſh the Son of God, and put him to an open ſhame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the ſeventh Commandement, firſt prohibite ſpiritual whoredom againſt God? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend,</hi> Jam. 4.4. <hi>Yee adulterers, and adultereſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the eighth precept, firſt reſtrain us from theft and robbery againſt God? Malac. 3.8. <hi>Will a man rob God? but ye have robbed me.</hi> Rom. 2.22. <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit ſacriledge?</hi> See Act. 12.22. in <hi>Herods</hi> example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115397:128"/>Doth not the ninth alſo, firſt inhibit a falſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the Lord? <hi>Jeremy</hi> 5.12. <hi>They have belyed the Lord, and ſaid it is not he,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.15. <hi>Yea, and we are found falſe witneſſes of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yea though the tenth commandement may ſeem to lay reſtraint upon us only in the behalf of our neighbor, yet who hath ſo neer vicinity to us as God in whom we live, move, and have our being, ſo that not only an open theſe againſt him, in taking that which belongs to him as <hi>Achon</hi> did, but even to aſſume, or once deſire that which belongs unto the Lord, is impious, as we ſee in <hi>Herod,</hi> who took, and conſequently affected the glory that was due to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.22, 23. <hi>Nor doth the Lord want a houſe, Iſa.</hi> 56.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.12, 13, 14. Nor is he deſtitute of a wife, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>And I ſware unto thee, and entered into a Covenant with thee ſaith the Lord, and thou becameſt mine</hi> See <hi>Re.</hi> 2. or of men ſervants and maid ſervants, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 116.16. <hi>Truly, O Lord, I am thy ſervant and the ſon of thine handmaid.</hi> Nor is he without his Oxen, and Aſſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. which if they be alienated from him in our deſires, it is a ſin of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence-againſt the laſt Commandement.</p>
                  <p>So that it is moſt true in this regard which Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole low, and yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all;</hi> for any one ſin againſt God breaks all the Commandements: <hi>It is Idolatry, witcheraft, murther, adultery,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Samuel 5.15.23.</p>
                  <p>And as the ſix laſt. firſt oppoſe ſin againſt God; ſo the four firſt in the ſecond place reſtrain ſins againſt man.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may not impoſe a falſe God upon our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, nor ſet up a falſe worſhip before him, nor ſwear falſly to his hurt, nor by prophaning the Lords Sabbath, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting reſt, before our neighbor, inſnare his ſoul: And what we ſpeak of the negativepart, is true of the affirmative, or poſſitive, throughout all the Commandements, ſo that the great duty of love to God, and our neighbor, ſeems to run through the veins of every Commandement. And as theſe two are inſeperable in the new creature, ſo the whole Law by the Apoſtles own Teſtimony, is fulfilled in this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115397:128"/>one Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf,</hi> Rom. 13.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. which cannot hold true, except the Lord be our firſt neighbor, who is to be loved in the firſt place; and ſurely if we ſhould not offer that wrong to God, which we would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, were we in his ſtead, we ſhould not ſin as we do.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section, you ſet not forth the whole extent of the Ceremonial Law which was to repreſent Chriſts inward death, and ſufferings, as well as his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>He being the Lamb ſlain in us from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8. and to be a document unto us, ſhewing how we muſt follow him unto eternal life; Howbeit you ſeem to go too far in ſaying, "It is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abrogated, now under the new Teſtament, for though the coſtly and burthenſome yoke, thereof is taken from the Gentiles, yet ſome part of it by the words of the Prophets may remaine in uſe among the Jews, after their calling, and reſtauration, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.23. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, ſhall all fleſh come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before me ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zach. 14.16, <hi>&amp;c. And it ſhall come to paſs that every one that is left of all the Nations that came againſt Jeruſalem ſhall even go up from yeer to yeer, to worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section, you yet ſeem to digreſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the truth, in ſaying, <q>That the judiciall law did expire with the ſtate of the Jewes;</q> for doubtleſs whenſoever their Commonwealth ſhall be reſtored, that Law ſhall be revived, yea how far it may now oblige all Chriſtian ſtates to follow, it is worth your inquiring.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <q>That the general equity of it may ſtill continue;</q> In which words you recommend the whole upon the matter: for what is there to be found in it, but equity it ſelf, can ever the Chriſtian Nations
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115397:129"/>hope to finde out better political Laws, then thoſe which firſt came from Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Yea what by the Teſtimony of almoſt all men were more to be wiſhed for in a Chriſtian ſtate, then that their Laws might be few in number, juſt in themſelves, and eafie to be known (as thoſe would be, if they were gathered into a body) and that ſuch as have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies might have a ſpeedy diſpatch as in <hi>Moſes</hi> his dayes?</p>
                  <p>In your fifth Section you do juſtly maintain the continued authority and obligation of the moral Law, over all perſons under the Goſpel. Where you truly affirm, <q>That Chriſt doth not any way diſſolve but muchſt engthen this obligation,</q> which thing he doth by <hi>his Doctrine, Mat.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18, 19. by <hi>his example,</hi> John 15.10. and eſpecially <hi>by the end of his coming,</hi> which is to fulfill it in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. and not for us (otherwiſe then we have ſhewed before) as you in your next Section, partly imply.</p>
                  <p>In your ſixth Section, though you do not ſhew what it is to be under the Law, yet there you truly ſet forth many moſt precious uſes of that law, even for the regenerate.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, you forget a ſingular peice of ſervice it did them in their firſt converſon by God their fathers cooperation, when it firſt made known their ſin and miſery unto them, and <hi>was their Schoolemaſter unto Chriſt</hi> Galatians 3.22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>At which time while we were under the work of the Law breeding fear of wrath (for we alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under the rule of it till it be dead) we were troubled with the ſpirit of bondage, which made us juſtly fear the wrath, and vengeance to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
                  <p>And this was the firſt great bower, and encliner of our wils, to leave our wicked wayes, and keep Gods Commandements, yet an impulſive, out of ſelf love, and ſelf preſervation for the preſent, till faith in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115397:129"/>Gods gracious promiſes did kindly melt, and charge our hearts to bewaile, and leave ſin; as alſo to work righteouſneſs out of love, and good will to him, that was ſo gracious towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And in this ſenſe we may grant you that which you ſpeak of in your ſeventh, and laſt Section of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſubduing our wils, for it is by the work of the Law that our pride is firſt brought down, and our ſtrong inclination to ſin, with ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That theſe forementioned uſes of the Law are not contrary to the grace of the Goſpel, but either make way for the ſame, or ſweetly comply therewith as you ſpeak in this laſt Section is undoubtedly true. And therefore the believer under the Covenant of grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill in ſome ſence under works. But yet if the Spirit of Chriſt both can, and uſually doth ſubdue our wils, and inable us freely, and chearfully to do the will of God, revealed in the law as you here ſpeak, what letteth but that our corruptions may be aboliſhed, our ſanctification perfected, and our obedience to the law made compleat, eſpecially if we ſeek that grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your former doctrines? Yea if Chriſt by his Spirit can, and will ſo fulfill the Law in us (which of the Saints made perfect in the world to come, you will not deny) what great need can there be at that time may ſome ſay of Chriſts outward obedience, to be our righteouſneſs? But of that ſufficiently before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:115397:130"/>For a concluſion then of this Chapter, as you here tacitly oppoſe the Antinomians, and other ſuch adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the law, ſo we pray you remember, that it is upon your own grounds, here and elſewhere, that they deſert the Law; for they thus argue, <hi>If Chriſt hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law for us in his active and perſonal obedience to make us compleatly righteous before God, what need is there of our obedience to the ſame?</hi> Yea ſome of them are ſo bold as to ſay, <hi>They ſee not how God in Juſtice can require obedience to his Law the ſecond time at our hands, which he hath both exacted, and obtained already, from his Son in our behalf,</hi> yea, <hi>why ſhould any ſtill periſh for their diſobedience againſt the Law, who yet believed on Chriſt as ſome do? Mat.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. Thus they argue for themſelves out of your own principles, ſo dangerous a thing it is to lay a ſandy foundation in the bottom of the ſtructure.

                  <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of Chriſtian liberty, and liberty of Conſcience examined</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis head of liberty is not now unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able when liberty hath got ſuch head, that almoſt every one affects that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which <hi>Tully</hi> deſcribes <hi>Poteſtas vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi ut velis,</hi> but if we may uſe that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we would both give, and take, you have too much reſtrained your Chriſtian freedom in your firſt Section, and liberty of conſciences in your ſecond, contradicted your ſelves in your third, and perhaps ſet the Governors too far at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in you fourth, and laſt.</p>
                  <p>In your firſt Section you faile in three things, firſt in that your enumeration of Chriſtian liberties, and freedoms, is to defective: ſecondly in that you reckon them up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly, and thirdly in that you miſtake ſome of them you name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:115397:132"/>For the firſt of thoſe, you have firſt left out our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the bondage, and bewitchment of carnal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and holineſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth,</hi> 1 Pet. 1 18, 19. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation received by tradition from your fathers,</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The exemption from the great bondage of fear, wherein ſome are held all their life long, juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting wrath and vengeance, is by you omitted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. <hi>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Freedom for Chriſtian Subjects, from the judicial Law as well as from the ceremonial, by your own confeſſion in the laſt chapter, eſpecially where other Laws not contrary to the word of God are impoſed upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A liberty to obſerve and omit ſome ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Laws, for the edifying of others and our own peace and indempnity, of which liberty in Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſpeaks expreſly; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3, 4. And as he uſed it himſelf at <hi>Cenchrea, Acts</hi> 18.18. and in circumciſing <hi>Timothy</hi> there, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. and that he did the like alſo with the adviſe of all the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.22, 23, 24. So he chargeth that we ſhould let no man condemn us for ſuch things, but either do them, or omit them as it is required, or expected at our hands, by the people with whom we are to converſe. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in reſpect of an holy day, or new moon, or the Sabbath, which are the ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You leave out our freedom from ſorrow, pain, &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.4, 7, 17.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly you have omitted the great freedom of the Spirit, when he in fulneſs is poured upon the Saints, or when the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from above deſcends upon them, which yet is not a freedom to ſin, but an immunity from fin, to walke with freedom, yea with delight in all the wayes of righteouſneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 26. <hi>But Jeruſalem which is from above is free, which is the mother of us all.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. <hi>Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:115397:132"/>To which liberties ſome add two more; one is a licenſe to obſerve any outward thing not forbidden in the word of God, which ſhall be enjoyned by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, or civil powers, becauſe the things that are without us defile us not; Thus ſay they, <hi>Paul became all things to all men, that he might win the more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Jews, he became a Jew, to them that were under the Law, as if he were ſtill under it: to them that were without Law, as without Law alſo, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under a Law to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20 21.</p>
                  <p>And 2dly a liberty to eat of things that had bin offred to Idols, when it offends not others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27, 28, 29. <hi>If any of them that beleeve not bid you to a feaſt, and ye be diſpoſed to goe, whatſoever is ſet before you eat, asking no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for conſcience ſake: But if any man ſay unto you, this is offered in ſacrifice to Idols, eat it not for his ſake that ſhewed it, and for conſcience ſake;</hi> conſcience I ſay, not thine own, but of others; for why is my liberty judged of another mans conſcience? Yea, ſome grow ſo far as to alow a liberty upon occaſion to be preſent, before an outward Idol without ſuperſtition or adoration in the heart, becauſe that the true beleevers well informed, know that ſuch an Idol is nothing in the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. That is ſay they, neither ſuch a God as ſome out of a ſuperſtitious devotion would make it, nor ſuch a Divel, or defiling thing as others out of their ſuperſtitious conceits, and feares would have it to be; this practiſe they would juſtify from <hi>Ezekiels</hi> preſence before Idols, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. throughout; and <hi>Pauls preſent beholding of</hi> Idols and Idolaters at <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 17, 23. And from the anſwer which <hi>Eliſha</hi> gave to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amaus</hi> quaere and ſcruple, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
                  <p>True it is indeed, That the great Idol is the God of this world, and next to him our luſts and corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. covetouſneſs; but any other thing by too much eſteem, love, or fear of it, or truſt, and confidence in it, may be made an Idol, even our Authors, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp; ſhepherds may be Idolized, <hi>Zac.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Zac.</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:115397:133"/>Your ſecond fail in this firſt Section, as we ſaid, is your prepoſterous placing of the Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties which you recite: for you ſet freedom from the guilt of ſin, the condemning wrath of God, and the curſe of the moral Law, before deliverance from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to ſin, and Satan, which in order of nature muſt go before as we have proved before.</p>
                  <p>Your third fail is in miſtakes, for the ſting of death is ſin it ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 6. which if it cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued wholy in this life, as you affirm, then the ſting of death cannot be wholy taken away, or we freed from it here.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe the victory which the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, is not that of the Grave, but of Hell, which is the inward condemnation of conſcience, againſt both which the Apoſtle triumphs, <hi>With thanksgiving, to God for the victory that is to be had in Chriſt Jeſus for all true beleevers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section you ſtraighten liberty of Conſcience, as much as you did Chriſtian freedom, in the firſt, for though the requiring of an implicite faith, be deſtructive to Liberty of Conſcience, and the impoſing of the doctrines, and precepts of men, upon us, as if they were the commandments of God (from which your ſelves are not free, in the next chapter, and elſewhere, is very injurious likewiſe; yet the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience may be divers other wayes inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and infringed.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, By violent means to ſeek to alter conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mens judgments, and their preſent perſwaſions; for it is the office of him that is the Lord of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>To lighten, and change mens mindes when, and how he pleaſeth.</hi> Phil. 3.15. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be thus minded; and if in any thing you be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveale this unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, By like forcible means, to incite anothe to will, and act, againſt his Conſcience, and much more by impriſonment, mulcts, terrours, or threats
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115397:133"/>
                     <hi>Romans</hi> 14.15, 20, 21. For this is to make him <hi>deſtroy his ſoul,</hi> verſe 20, 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may not diſturbe the peace of mens Conſciences, or make their hearts ſad with our inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, or menacing them cauſeleſsly, with terrours from the Lord, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 13.32. <hi>Becauſe with lies ye have made the hearts of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section, you do deſervedly oppoſe the practice of any ſin, and the cheriſhing of any the leaſt ſinful luſt, upon pretence of Chriſtian Liberty; But whereas you add, 'That this is to deſtroy the end of Chriſtian Liberty; which you there place in two things, deliverance from the hands of our enemies, and a freedom to ſerve the Lord without fear in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and righteouſneſs before him all the daies of our life, you in ſome ſort contradict your ſelves in calling theſe the end of our Chriſtian Liberty, which you had in the firſt Section made two main parts of our Chriſtian Liberty, as indeed they are.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section you have ſet good bounds betwixt the ſubjects or ſubordinates, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſaying; <q>That they who upon pretence of Chriſtian Liberty, ſhall oppoſe any lawful power or the lawful exerciſe of it, whether it be Civil or Ecle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical <hi>reſiſt the Ordinances of God.</hi>
                     </q> Wherein your Doctrine is ſound and good, whatever your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice hath been or may be to the contrary: For God is the Author of order, and not of confuſion, and he which hath armed ſuperiors according to their ſtate and degree with authority, hath impoſed ſubjection in all lawful things, with many other reſpective duties upon the inferiours and ſubordinates.</p>
                  <p>It is true likewiſe, <hi>That no ſuch opinions ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed or practiſes maintained as are contrary to the light of Nature to the known and received Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in all Ages, eſpecially thoſe of the Primitive and pureſt times, whether they concerne Faith, Worſhip; or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115397:134"/>or are oppoſite to the power of Godlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how far the different opinions and judgements of men, may by learned men, who yet want ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eies, be judged erroneous, prejudicial to the power of Godlineſs, either in their own nature, or in the manner of publiſhing and maintaining them, we know not.</p>
                  <p>We are as much for modeſty, and ſobriety in men, and as far from any thing that is deſtructive to the external Peace and Order which Chriſt hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Church or Common Wealth, as your ſelves or any other.</p>
                  <p>But we would not have you aſſume to your ſelves, or attribute unto others a power <hi>to lord it over mens Faith and Conſciences,</hi> eſpecially when men walk obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently towards thoſe that are in places of Rule and Authority, and live a <hi>Godly, honeſt, ſober, peaceable, and unblamable life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Men will do wickedly, and pretend a liberty in Chriſt ſo to do, let them be liable to the ſword of Juſtice for ſo doing. But far be it from us ſo much as by example to draw a weak brother, a Saint and fellow ſervant of the Lord, whom no man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but for his different judgement, to do any thing againſt Conſcience, whereby he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himſelf, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Romans</hi> 14. How much more ought Governours to be tender, and abſtemious in the uſe of violent and coercive meanes, to precipitate men into ſuch perilous and deſtructive courſes. All Authority is given of God for mens welfare, and much more for the Preſervation, and not the Deſtruction of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>But Brethren, you which are ſo punctual in teaching the Subject his duty to free your ſelves from flattery, temporiſing, or partiallity, might have done God and his people, yea, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115397:134"/>themſelves no diſſervice in minding them of their duties alſo, and ſo ſetting due limits, and boundaries to their authority and the exerciſe of it over their Brethren.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of Religious Worſhip and of the Sabboth Day. examined.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the foregoing Chapters you gave us a ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of your faith, and here you exhibite a view of your piety or Religion, but as your faith was many wayes unſound; ſo your Religion for the greateſt part will prove a will worſhip, and both it and the time you allot thereunto, are ſo ungrounded, that we can neither Sabbatize in your worſhip, nor worſhip your sabboth with you.</p>
                  <p>You have here touched many things that concern that worſhip; as the object, the rule, the part or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with which, the ſuppoſed matter the Place, and time of it after your manner, but we cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at four things, firſt your ſtrange omiſſions, ſecondly ſome truths which break from you at unawares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting what you ſaid before, thirdly your groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and laſtly your confident affirming of things moſt falſe, and deſtitute of foundation.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt it is no ſmall matter of wonderment to us, that you neither ſhew us what the worſhip of God is, nor of what latitude in the general, nor how many kinds there be of it, nor wherein Gods principal, eternal, and ſaving worſhip lieth, eſpecially ſince the holy Scriptures are ſo clear in all the four, which ſet forth unto us;</p>
                  <p>Firſt that to worſhip God is all one as to fear him, ſerve him, and glorifie him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>It is written thou
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115397:137"/>ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalts thou ſerve,</hi> with <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13, and 10.20. See <hi>Revelations</hi> 14.7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that our obedience to God and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in general are of equal latitude, <hi>John</hi> 9 13. <hi>Now we know that God heareth not ſinners, but if any man be a worſhiper of him, and do his will, him he heareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly that there are many kinds and degrees of divine worſhip as the worſhip of Angels which they owe to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. <hi>Worſhip him all ye gods,</hi> and the worſhip due from men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>worſhip thou God.</hi> This humane worſhip is manifold.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, either Typical or real, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>That we ſhould now ſerve him in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A glorifying or worſhipping him inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and another which is done only in an outward manner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13, 14. <hi>For as much as this people draw neer unto me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me is taught by the precepts of men,</hi> therefore <hi>behold I will proceed to do a marvelous work, &amp;c.</hi> Matth, 15.8. and 7.6, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that there is a primary and ſecondary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the former inſtituted for it ſelf, and accepted in it ſelf: the other, for and in the former only, Hoſ. 6.6. <hi>For I deſired mercy and not ſacrifice, and the knowledg of God more then burnt offerings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the primary, immutable, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiferous worſhip of God (of which you ſpeak no one word either in this your Confeſſion of Faith, or in your directory for worſhip in the name of a divine worſhip) ſtands in the following of God and walking with him in his loving and everlaſting righteouſneſs, as theſe places fully evict, <hi>God created man in his own Image and ſimilitude, Gen.</hi> 1.27. to wit, that therein he ſhould ſerve and worſhip his God; and Chriſt is given for this end, Luk. 1.74, 75. <hi>That we being delivered out of the hands
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115397:137"/>of our enemies might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of our life,</hi> and not in one day in ſeven as you imagine. Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. So did <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. Thus God required of <hi>Abraham, that he ſhould walk before him,</hi> or with him, <hi>and be perfect in that way,</hi> Gen. 17.1. this was the Religion that <hi>Abraham</hi> taught his family even by Gods own teſtimony, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>For I know him that he will command his children and houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord to do juſtice and judgement, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> Thus the Prophets Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and inſtructed the people, <hi>Micah.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Wherewithall ſhall I come before the Lord, and how my ſelf before the moſt hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h God,</hi> that is the queſtion to which he anſwers, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to humble thy ſelf to walk with thy God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi> Thus <hi>Phynehas,</hi> and the holy prieſts both walked, and taught, <hi>Malachy</hi> 2 6. <hi>The Law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lipps, he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many from iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that worſhip in the Spirit or work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is required by the father, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in truth;</hi> where the word Spirit is by a metony my put for the work of the Spirit, for the whole fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs and righteouſneſs, and truth, <hi>Eph</hi> 5.9. and the word Truth there implies the whole divine nature, or new creature in oppoſition to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall ſervices?</p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtle ſhews both wherein the Kingdom of God, and his acceptable worſhip lyeth, <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.17, 18. <hi>For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt; And he that in theſe things ſerveth the Lord Chriſt is accepted of God, and approved of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far concerning your omiſſions, whereof this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115397:138"/>laſt is a moſt groſs, defect in them that would teach a whole Kingdom the way of Religion rightly: For the truths which you have here at unawares confeſſed they are principally three, all which reflect upon your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is that where in the firſt Section you affirm, That the very light of nature ſheweth that there is a God who hath Lordſhip and Soveraignty over all, who is good and doth good unto all, and is therefore to be feared, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, praiſed, called upon, truſted in, and ſerved with all the heart, and with all the ſoul, and with all the might. If then the light of nature extend ſo far, why may not all men be ſaved, if they walke according to that light in turning to that God thus made known unto them, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him and ſerving him in all the wayes of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and goodnes, in calling upon him for the pardon of their ſins, the healing of their errors and corruptions, the leading of them into all truth and righteouſneſs, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if illuminating grace be added thereto, which truth you have denyed before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you ſay in the ſame Section, <q>That Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſo limited by himſelf, and his revealed will, that he is not to be worſhipped after the imaginations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of men,</q> which is moſt true, but it fals ſoul upon your worſhip here deſcribed, which is for the moſt part a meer imagination, and humane invention, or tradition as it is obtruded upon us, for a worſhip, which we will ſhew by and by.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in you fourth Section, you ſay, that prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all ſorts of men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that ſhall live hereafter, who ſin not the ſin unto death, but not for thoſe that are dead. If prayer ſhould and muſt be made for all ſorts of men, that do, or that ſhall live hereafter, then either there is no abſolute decree in God to debar men of ſalvation, or we muſt pray expreſly againſt Gods will, or in our prayers not ſeek mens ſalvation, which how it contradicts your former doctrine, we ſhall report it to your ſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the miſtakes, they are neither ſmal nor few in this place.</p>
                  <p>For firſt you take it for granted that there is an outward
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115397:138"/>worſhip of God inſtituted by Chriſt in the new Teſtament in lieu of that ceremonial worſhip of the old Teſtament new accompliſhed and abrogated by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <q>That there hath been an outward worſhip of God inſtituted from the Creation, and a ſet time even the ſeventh day from the Creation appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all which are meer dreams.</q> For though the Fathers before and after the Flood, ſometimes ſacrificed voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by inſtinct, it were as a monument of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufferings with his future paſſion, and to repreſent the way wherein we muſt follow him into life, but there was no preſcript or ſet form of outward worſhip enjoyned to the ſons of men, till the dayes of <hi>Moſes;</hi> nor then to any others but the Iſraelites, and that when they were mad upon outward things, witneſs their making of the golden Calf.</p>
                  <p>True it is, That the holy Prophets, and Saints of the primitive Church, ſhortly after the Apoſtles dayes, ſeeing that the people then were grown outwardly minded alſo, did for unity and edification ſake, bring in a form of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, called the Liturgy, which was both pious, and very profitable, and how far it may oblige us to obſerve it, we will not here diſpute; But the forms of worſhip that now are in the reformed Churches are but prudential, and not <hi>Jure divino.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas you make thankſgiving and prayer to be a part of Gods ſet ſolemn, primary, and preſcript worſhip.</p>
                  <p>We grant that thanſgiving ſhall be a part of Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting worſhip in Heaven, but prayer with the reading of the holy Scriptures, ſound preaching, and conſcionable hearing of the word, the holy adminiſtration, and receiving of the Sacraments, the ſinging of Pſalms, extraordinary faſts, oaths, vows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which you make parts of Divine worſhip, are onely holy duties, and means appointed by the Lord, for the begetting, and edifying of his Church, but no parts of any ſet or preſcript worſhip as you imagine, yet are they piouſly and often to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you are miſtaken, not onely in the matter, but in the time which is by you ſet a part thereunto, that being
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115397:139"/>left to the care, piety, prudence, and convenience of the Churches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the fourth Commandment as it is poſitive bind any but the Iſraelites, nor was the ſeventh day or the laſt day of the week to be kept as a Sabboth from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation till the reſurrection of Chriſt. For that which is ſpoken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. <hi>That God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it,</hi> may be two wayes underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Firſt by way of Anticipation, a thing uſual in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.33, 34, 35. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. Or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly it may be ſpoken of Chriſt in whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath reſted from all his works, and whom he hath bleſſed and ſanctified for ever.</p>
                  <p>Neither was that day from the reſurrection of Chriſt changed into the firſt day of the week by Chriſt, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as you affirm.</p>
                  <p>His ariſing upon that day, or his appearing to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, upon or ſhortly after that day without a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obſerve it, do not any way enforce the obſervation of it; The two places to which you refer us, carry alſo little force with them; for that in the <hi>Acts, Chap.</hi> 20.7. We ſay that the occaſion of that meeting was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to wit <hi>Paul</hi> being ready to depart the next day, and not likely to ſee them any more, ſent for them, and their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not till the firſt day of the week was ended, for it was in the night that they met.</p>
                  <p>And the other place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. not ſpeaking of a publick contribution to be made upon the firſt day of the week, but of a private laying a part of ſome money for ſuch publike uſes, rather proves that day to be a working day (when the Saints were to begin their next weeks work) then an holy day.</p>
                  <p>Nor finally is it clear, that this day is called the Lords Day, and muchleſs that it was inſtituted for a perpetual holy day, or Chriſtian Sabbath, for that place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. ſeems not to ſpeak of any outward time; for when the Prophets and Apoſtles purpoſe to intimate the time when they received the word of the Lord, they never omit the yeer, or moneth; as <hi>John</hi> doth, ſo that if he here would hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115397:139"/>the time, it may rather ſeem he ſpeaks of the annual day of Chriſts reſurrection, whoſe mouth was then well known, then of the weekly day. But there is an inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual day of the Lord, and ſo a true and ſpiritual Lords Day, which the Saints hoped for, and this as it ſeems was now appeared unto <hi>John, Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>But exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo much the rather as you ſee the day approaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.7, 8. <hi>So that you come behinde in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the day dawn, and the day Star a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in your hearts,</hi> of which coming of his as Chriſt had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his promiſe to all his diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.18. <hi>I will not leave you Orphans, I will come again unto you;</hi> So he in ſpecial intimates that <hi>John</hi> ſhould live to ſee the ſame, and ſhare therein, <hi>John</hi> 21.22. <hi>Jeſus ſpeaking of John, ſaith thus to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur, If I will that he ſhall tarry till I come, what is that to thee:</hi> which coming of Chriſts can be no other then that his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual coming promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 14.21, 25. And indeed thoſe latter words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Lords day ſeem to expound the former words, <hi>I was in the ſpirit,</hi> and to declare what meaſure and degree of the ſpirit, he had then attained when he received that revelation. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever moſt certain it is that the obſervation of our Lords Day was firſt taken up by the voluntary, and prudential act of the Primitive Churches, and afterwards that day with Wedneſday and Friday were commanded to be dayes of holy Aſſemblies by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, and other holy Emperors, as Eccleſiaſtical Hyſtories teſtifie with one conſent, and the greateſt part of modern writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
                  <p>So that your propoſitions in the ſeventh Section which we have denyed, are very raſh and bold aſſertions, ſome whereof are alſo very injurious, for how can thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys which have either a perpetual day, or a perpetual night for many moneths together every yeer, punctually obſerve ſuch an outward Sabboth, as you impoſe.</p>
                  <p>We grant that the fourth Commandement is moral as well as the reſt, but the morality of it lyeth not in appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one day in ſeven for a publike outward worſhip (nor
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115397:140"/>was it appointed for that end by <hi>Moſes;</hi> though after he returns from <hi>Babylon</hi> in part ſo uſed, but rather for a figurative reſt) but in reſting from our own finful thoughts, words, and works through the help of Chriſt in keeping Gods Judgements, and Commandements through his aſſiſtance, and in ſeeking our eternal ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, life and reſt in him; as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus Hieronym.</hi> and almoſt all the ancients with the beſt of our modern writers unanimouſly agree. Chriſt ſaith, that he <hi>Gave the Sabboth to be a ſign that he is the Lord that Sanctifieth us,</hi> Exod. 31.13. Ezek. 20.12. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That not only the other holy dayes, but even the Sabboth were a ſhadow in the old Teſtament, and the body of them is in Chriſt:</hi> Col. 2.16, yea that the Sabboth which is ſpoken of, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 58.13. is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom we muſt not trample under foot, by ſpeaking our own words, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own thoughts, and doing our own pleaſure, as the ſaid Fathers expound the place: In your laſt Section, as your Sabboth it ſelf, ſo your ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is an humane deviſe, any day may be ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>But for a concluſion of this Chapter, we offer five things to your better conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, whether Gods will is ſince changed, who at the firſt created man after his own Image, and eſtabliſhed him in all righteouſneſs, that he might worſhip him therein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether he would be worſhipped at our hands one day in ſeven, or all the dayes of our lives? See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1, 71, 75. before cited, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ſitteth upon the throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whether the thoughts, words, and works, which are called our own, and from which we are commanded to reſt, that we may ſanctifie the Lords Sabbath, be thoſe which are neceſſarily employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the honeſt duties of our lawful callings, or our
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115397:140"/>ſinful, thoughts, words, and actions? See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.7: <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,</hi> Iſaiah 58.6, 7, 8. <hi>Their works are works of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the act of violence is in their hands, their feet run to evil, and they make haſt to ſhed innocent blood, their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, waſting and deſtruction are in their paths,</hi> Jer. 3.5. <hi>Behold thou haſt ſpoken, and done evil things, as thou couldeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whether the Lord would rather have an outward day or time which is one of the moſt tranſient and fluxible things of this world, or his everlaſting light, life, and reſt, Chriſt Jeſus honored by us. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. <hi>Worſhip him all yee Gods,</hi> Mat. 17.5. <hi>And behold a voice out of the cloud, which ſaid this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him,</hi> Joh. 5.23. <hi>That all men ſhould honor the Son, as they honor the father,</hi> Iſa, 58.13. And ſhall honor him; where the Sabboth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the beginning of the verſe is turned into a perſon, the perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who by our ſinning againſt him is troden, or trampled under foot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. and therefore it is not without cauſe that we are here, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. commanded to turn or keep our feet from the Sabboth, that is from trampling upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, whether we ſhall attain thoſe high things promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14. to wit, to be fed with the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Jacob</hi> our Father. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by forbearing the works of our lawful callings one day in ſeven, or by abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſting through the help of Chriſt from our own wicked thoughts, words, and works, all the dayes of our life, that ſo we may keep Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and commandments which are his leſſer Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56.2. and finde all righteouſneſs, reſt, and life in Chriſt the great Sabboth and Lords Day, or Day of the Lord in his ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, whether you do not worſhip God in vain here teaching for doctrines the precepts of men, <hi>Matthew.</hi> 15.9. for the Lord hath neither inſtituted theſe duties for a ſet and ſolemn outward worſhip, which you make the ſeveral parts of his outward worſhip, nor hath he appointed any other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but the ſerving him in ſpirit and in truth, <hi>John</hi> 4.23, 24. And although the duties you inſiſt upon, are appointed by him as helps and furtherances to the attaining of that grace whereby we may ſo worſhip God, and may in that ſenſe paſs for a ſecondary worſhip, yet are they not limitted by him to any ſet time, but rather are leſt to the Churches convenience and care, to her piety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

                  <p>If ye fay that ye keep not the Jewiſh Sabboth, but have turned that into the Lords Day to be Rept after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>Then in the third place may it not be ſaid unto you by the Lord, as it is, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.12. <hi>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required theſe things at your bands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of lawful Oaths and Vows examined.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALthough you would not ſo eaſily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in this chapter, as in ſome of the former, the matter being more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and very obvious, yet have you here your defects and miſtakes alſo, ſo that we cannot ſwear to all that you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning oaths and vows.</p>
                  <p>And firſt we demand of you wherefore you have here in this tractate of Religious oaths and vows, made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of covenants, and proteſtations, things of late ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perſued, and not without your contrivance, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, or conſent.</p>
                  <p>More particularly in the firſt Section where you ſpeak of oaths, as you do in the three following.</p>
                  <p>You affirm two things which muſt be either warily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or elſe they are falſe.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, That an oath is a part of Religious worſhip, which we grant to be true, that worſhip being taken in an equal latitude, with the fear and ſervice of God as it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. &amp; 10.20. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. but you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115397:144"/>here an outward ſet, and ſolemn publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as in the foregoing chapter, you ſeem to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your ſelves: For is the taking of an oath tyed to the Sabbath day, as your worſhip is? Or is any day of the week ſanctified therewith? Or can you well diſtinguiſh it into a publick and private worſhip, as you do other duties? Indeed, if religious worſhip conſiſt herein, this is one of the moſt religious ages that ever were, Oaths of all ſorts being never ſo common as now.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you ſay, but not truly, "That the perſon ſwearing alwayes calleth God ſolemnly to witneſs what he aſſerteth, or promiſeth, and to judge him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth or fallehood of what he ſweareth, for although God is ſuch a witneſs and judge, and our publick oaths in <hi>England,</hi> run moſt in ſuch a form, yet all oathes do not ſo, yea very few of thoſe jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioned in the Scriptures, are explicitely ſo formed; we know not whether you can add another to that which the Apoſtle uſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Moreover I call God for a record upon my ſoul, that to ſpare you I came not yet to Corinth.</hi> This form is very ſolemn, lawful, and commendable, but not expreſly uſed in all oaths.</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section you have firſt told us, that which is true in the general, that it is Gods name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by which men ought to ſwear, but you have not declared what that name is: For Gods name is either appellative, or elſe eſſential, and real; his Being, by name fignifyed by <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is firſt his Divine nature in himſelf. <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 28.58. <hi>That thou mayſt fear this glorious and ſearful name</hi> (or being) <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Proverbs</hi> 18.10. <hi>The name</hi> (or being) <hi>of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous run unto it and are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, His name is his Image, or like being in his Saints, <hi>Zac.</hi> 10.12. <hi>For I will ſtrengthen them, and they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115397:144"/>ſhall walk up and down in the name of the Lord:</hi> This is that name of Chriſt, wherein <hi>If two or three be aſſembled, he is, and will be in the midſt of them, Mat.</hi> 18.20. This is that new name of his which he hath promiſed to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the overcomer, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſwear by Gods name, is firſt to ſwear by that dreadful and glorious being.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſwear in his like being, that is, in all righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, To ſwear that Jehovah or the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, is properly to ſwear that he liveth in us, in his like being. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth in truth, in judgement, and in righteouſneſs, and the nations ſhall bleſs themſelves in him, and in him ſhall they glory.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.10. <hi>As the truth of Chriſt is in me, no man ſhall ſtop me of this boaſting in</hi> Achaia. So to ſay or ſwear that God liveth in us when he doth not, is to take his name in vain, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though thou</hi> Iſrael <hi>tranſgreſs, yet let not</hi> Judah <hi>offend, and come ye not to</hi> Gilgal, <hi>nor go up to</hi> Beth aven, (or houſe of vanity) <hi>nor ſwear the Lord liveth.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.1. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.16. What name is that which the Lord ſweareth ſhould be no more named in the mouth of any of thoſe which had forſaken him, and whom he had now finally rejected; but his like being which he withholdeth from his enemies and obſtinate rebels againſt him?</p>
                  <p>Jeremiah 44.26. <hi>Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord all</hi> Judah, <hi>and you that dwell in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>Behold I have ſworn by my great name</hi> (or being) <hi>ſaith the Lord; that my name ſhall be no more named in the mouth of any man in</hi> Judah, <hi>in all the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſaying the Lord liveth,</hi> to wit, <hi>in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſay in the ſame Section, <q>That to ſwear vainly or raſhly by that glorious and dreadful name is ſinful,</q> but why have you made no mention of forſwearing by that name, perjury being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil of all ſinful kindes of ſwearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:115397:145"/>Thirdly, you ſay, "That to ſwear by any other thing is ſinful, whereas the Apoſtle ſwears by the <hi>truth or work of Chriſt in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.15. <hi>And by the rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing which he had in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.31. unleſs we ſhould take this laſt for an aſſeveration onely. But as the Lord ſometimes ſwears by himſelf, and his whole being, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. and ſometimes by ſome particular attribute of his, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62 8. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his ſtrength.</hi> So it may ſeem that men may ſwear, either by his whole being or by ſome part of it, and have the Lords practiſe for their warrant.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is true, that you ſpeak, <q>That a lawful oath, is warranted under the New Teſtament, as well as under the Old;</q> yet is there a greater reſtraint of ſwearing laid upon us now, then in the old Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>James</hi> 5.12. which hath made ſome to ſhun all oathes, though called to ſwear by the Magiſtrate in matters lawful.</p>
                  <p>In the third Section you give good cautions to them that are to take an oath, ſaying, <q>He that taketh an oath ought duly to conſider the weightineſs of ſuch an act:</q> but none to thoſe which impoſe the ſame, as if men might not ſin in impoſing unneceſſary, ſubtil, and inſnaring oaths, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.3.4. There is a curſe goet out againſt ſwearers, aſwel as againſt Theeves; becauſe of needleſs ſwearing aſwel as falſe ſwearing, <hi>A land is made to mourn,</hi> Jer. 23.10.</p>
                  <p>Again in the ſame Section you ſay, <q>It is a ſin to refuſe an oath, touching any thing that is good and juſt,</q> being impoſed by lawful authority: where you imply that onely ſuch as be in authority may require an oath, but the maſter may require it from his ſervant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.23. and one equal of another, as <hi>Laban</hi> did of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31.44, 45, 46. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour ſometimes of a ſuperiour, as the poor <hi>Amalekite</hi> ſervant did of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.15, 16, yet all this upon weighty occaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:115397:145"/>Laſtly, All lawful oaths are to be ſo taken as you ſpeak in that fourth Section; but whether a tyrannical oath tending to the deſtruction of the Saints, either the ſwearer himſelf, or his fellow Saints may not when it is enforced, be taken with ſome lawful reſervation, or equivocation, when the words will bear it, is a querie among the Schoolmen.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning vowes, of which you ſpeak in your three laſt Sections.</p>
                  <p>We firſt grant that there is a great deale of affinity betwixt a vow, and a promiſſary oath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are commanded to be wary, and well adviſed in our vows, yea, to be ſparing therein, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Better it is that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay,</hi> &amp;c. So we cannot eaſily be too abſtemious in taking of oathes, unleſs it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great and juſt occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The true Saint, or ſervant of God is deſcribed by this adjunct of fearing an oath, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. <hi>As is the good, ſo is the ſinner, and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We concur with you concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom the things about which, and the manner how vows are to be made, as alſo concerning the faithful keeping of them, and of all lawful oaths.</p>
                  <p>Finally we agree, That Popiſh vows of perpetual poverty, oftentimes of regular obedience, and of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick life, are neither warantable, nor true degrees of an higher perfection; but rather ſuperſtitious, and ſinful ſnares, wherein Chriſtians ſhould not entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet muſt it be granted that ſome may reſolve of fingle life, and in ſome ſort through the aſſiſtance of God vow ſo to continue, 1 Cor. 7.37. <hi>Nevertheleſs he that ſtandeth ſtedfaſt in his heart, having no neceſſity, but hath power over his own will, and hath de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115397:146"/>made Eunuches of men, and there be Eunuches which have made themſelves Eunuches for the Kingdom of God; he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</hi> The like may be ſaid of ſuch Canons as are in themſelves peaceable, pious, or lawful, of which one may lawfully vow, that by Gods aſſiſtance he will be regular in the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But though the ſuperſtitious ſnares muſt be confeſſed to be ſinful, yet there may lie other kindes of ſnares in oaths, vows, and covenants, made by ſelf ſeeking men, under ſpecious pretences, which may be no leſs perilous or wicked then the other: what ſay you to a mutinous ſnare among the Souldiers, when ſome private Officer, or Souldiers draw their fellows into a combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their General, or the body of the Army, by preſſing a ſelf made League, or Covenant? What think you of a Schiſmatical or Heretical ſnare, when ſome of the Clergy, or Laity, to ſpread their own opinions, or ſtrengthen themſelves againſt their adverſaries, or to make themſelves great, draw others into an oath, and combination with them? What opinion have you of a rebellious confederation, bound up with ſolemn vows, and oathes, ſuch as was that in the late Iriſh Rebels and Murtherers? Are not all theſe ſinful ſnares and entanglements.</p>

The firſt of alawful and uſurped Magiſtracy. The ſecond of a ſupream, and a ſubordinate.

                  <p>Your firſt Section holds true of lawful Magiſtrates, <q>That they are ordained of God for his glory and the publick good,</q> and that he, and he alone hath armed them with the ſword; but not alwayes of uſurpers, that they ſhould be Gods appointed miniſters, unleſs it be in wrath as his ſcourges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:115397:148"/>Your ſecond Section is true: Firſt in this, That Chriſtians may accept and execute the Office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, Of ſuch Chriſtian Magiſtrates it is, and muſt be underſtood, that they ought to maintain Piety, as well as Juſtice and Peace, according to the wholeſome Lawes of their reſpective Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but eſpecially according to the Law and mind of God.</p>
                  <p>And finally, It is true of them, aſwel a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the meer Civil Magiſtrate, that they may make war upon juſt, and great occaſion, though <hi>Hierom</hi> and ſome of the Fathers be of another opinion; yet is not this true of the inferiour Magiſtrate making an offenſive war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſupream, as moſt writers conclude.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section, you monopolize, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry partial if not plainly injurious to the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, eſpecially if he be a ſpiritual or inſpired perſon in denying him authority to adminiſter the Word and Sacraments, and the power of the Keyes. What ſay you to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to <hi>Melchezedech,</hi> to <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>David?</hi> Is not <hi>Solomon</hi> called a Preacher?

                  <p>Give us leave to ask you theſe queſtions. Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Saints are not now to be Kings and Prieſts? See <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Secondly, whether the Prieſts office is ſo limitted, and reſtrained now to perſons, as it was in the time of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro:</hi> 26.18 and of <hi>Uzzah</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. Thirdly, who brought in this diſtinction of Laity and Clergy in the New Teſtament? Laſtly, whence have you your authority ſo to adminiſter the Word and the Sacraments, and to uſe the power of the Keys, as you do in peculiar? you may have <hi>jus Civile,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticum</hi> for it, but not <hi>jus Divinum,</hi> an humane, or Eccleſiaſtical title, but not a Divine right, and may not he that derives it unto you, have a ſhare therein if he have gifts, and qualifications for it?</p>

                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:115397:148"/>Now what you affirm incontinently in that Section, <q>That it is his duty to take order that peace and unity be preſerved in the Church, That all blaſphemies, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies be ſuppreſſed, That all corruptions, and abuſes in worſhip, and diſcipline, be prevented, or reformed, That all the ordinances of God be duly ſettled admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and obſerved; and that for this end he hath power, to call Synods, to be preſent at them, and to provide that whatſoever is tranſacted in them be according to the minde of God.</q>

                  <p>The firſt is this, you there ſay, <q>That it is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates duty to ſee that the truth of God be kept pure,</q> which indeed can never be corrupted.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly you ſay, <q>It is his office, to ſee that all the ordinances of God be duely ſettled, adminiſtred, and obſerved;</q> which is true of his ſpiritual ordinances e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, and theſe are firſt the commandments of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and then his other precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In your Directory for worſhip you have omitted the ten Commandements, Gods principal ordinances, but highly magnified your kinde of preaching, which hath more of art, then of the ſpiritual gift of Prophecy in it, your keeping of an outward day in every week holy, with

                     </gap>rdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Is not this to change the ordinances as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes?</p>
                  <p>In your fourth which is your laſt Section. <q>You firſt ſet out the reſpective duties of Subjects to Magiſtrates well and truly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly you rightly affirm, <q>That neither difference in religion, no nor Infidelity it ſelf do make void the Magiſtrates juſt, and legal authority, nor free the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their due obedience to him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Infidelity it ſelf cannot do this what other thing can? Yet it muſt be granted, that when Magiſtrates are eſective, and choſen conditionally, the breaking of a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal condition may diſanull his place and claim.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly you ſay here, <q>That Eccleſiaſtical perſons are not exempted from their obedience,</q> which is but true in part, in regard of civil honor, obedience, and all needful aſſiſtance eſpecially where the Magiſtrate is no more but civil: But in matters of faith, ſalvation, and damnation, the conſciences not only of Eccleſiaſtical perſons, as you call them; but of laicks themſelves are exempted from his tyranny, and force; therein they are only the ſubjects of Chriſt: Yea in theſe things ſome perſons may have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Magiſtrate himſelf in the Lord, though that Magiſtrate be a Chriſtian alſo, to wit, ſuch perſons as are inſpired and ſent of God to be his mouth, as <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſtly you juſtly ſhut out the Pope, and his juriſdiction from us, as thoſe which have taken the oath of ſupremacy, but here you are too general in your affirmatives for want of due diſtinction, or limitation, for in ſome parts of <hi>Italy</hi> which are the Popes inheritance, he hath power and authority over his ſubordinate officers, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as other Princes have, and may juſtly deprive thoſe that are under him, of dominions and lives, when they break ſuch capital Laws as deſerve death, confiſcation, and diſinheriting, but he may not do this to forraign Princes and States, nor to their people who are not under his lawful
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115397:149"/>juriſdiction; whether upon the pretence of hereſie, or any other like pretext: Yet ſome Papiſts are confident of this, that now you have deprived the Pope of his deprivative authority over Princes, you will aſſume it to your ſelvs, or beſtow it upon your friends, when and where you think good to ſerve your own turns.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, ſince thoſe that marry, <hi>ſhall have trouble in the fleſh</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.28. and marrying brings with it of neceſſity many avocations, lets, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions from attending upon Gods ſervice, and the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his kingdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32, 33, 34. you might very ſeaſonably in theſe calamitous times (wherein the people like the generation before the flood, are mad upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying) have ſhewed that as <hi>omnia prius tentanda quam belle expertendum;</hi> ſo all means ſhould be uſed, firſt to get the gift of continency before people incurre the wants, cares, burthens, ſorrows, and diſtractions of the marriage yoke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſince our firſt parents were not joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till both were ſettled in the Image of God, that the Lord might have a godly ſeed upon earth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. you might have declared that not only maturity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that grace and regeneration, eſpecially in the Church of God is firſt to be ſought before an husband, or wife, that they may live in the fear of God together, and bring up their ſeed in that fear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly you ſpeak nothing of the adviſe and conſent which children ſhould ask of their wife, and godly parents and guarcians, before they diſpoſe of themſelves in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:115397:151"/>Fourthly in ſetting forth the ends, why marriage was Inſtituted; you have omitted the maine (which the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Liturgy did not forge:) to wit, that it was ordained for a figure and repreſentation of the miſtical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his Church; and that therein it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a great myſtery, a kinde of Sacrament; of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly you are ſilent concerning the reciprocall duties of the marryed perſons, ſuch as cohabitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. mutual benevolence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2, 3. of abſtinence ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times either by conſent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5, or by injunction from the Lord <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.19. nor do you ſet forth either the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of husbands to their wives, or of wives toward their husbands, in their ſpecials, or particulars.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you ſet not forth this, That perſons may commit ſpiritual adultery againſt God, even in marrying while their hearts are more ſet upon the pleaſures of carnall copulation, then upon ſpiritual communion with God.</p>
                  <p>The miſtakes which we would repreſent unto you are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you ſay, <q>That thoſe which profeſs the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion ſhould not marry with Infidels;</q> where we deſire your adviſed reſolution to theſe two things; ſince there are ſeveral Religions, each by their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective profeſſors accounted the true reformed Religion, which of theſe will you pitch upon, <hi>Lutheran, Calviniſtical, Socinian, Attainian,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> formerly eſtabliſhed by law, all which are different. To ſay nothing of the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sects of <hi>Antinomians, Seperatiſts. Anchaptiſts, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, Levellers, Illuminates, Ranters,</hi> or Gods of Godmanche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with their adherents.</p>
                  <p>Secondly wherein doth he that profeſſeth the reformed Religion; and yet is in the ſtate of unregeneracy, and unbelief, yea perhaps of a moſt profane heart, and life, deſerve ſo well that he may not marry with an Infidel; many of the Heathen whom you account infidels, being men of better life and more truly conſcientious though they know not Chriſt in the fleſh, then thouſands that are called
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115397:152"/>Chriſtians, and living in the Cities and Countries of the reformed as you call them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you ſay, <q>That ſuch profeſſors of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</q> may not intermarry with Papiſts: Why we pray you? Becauſe the Lord reproves <hi>Judah</hi> for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the daughter of a ſtrange god, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.11. But do not the Papiſts believe in the ſame God, with the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, even in <hi>the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> though they differ in ſome articles, or branches of articles of their belief, and in their way of worſhip? Yea are not ſome of the Papiſts regenerate, conſcientious and vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: If then the Proteſtant and Papiſts be both Saints or ſanctified perſons, then they have both one Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, If they be both unregenerate, the divel is yet father to them both: But you will ſay, that difference in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs breed alienation in affection, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the ſervice of God, if not ſeducement.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, that firſt it is the ſimilitude of natures, and diſpoſitions which conciliates love.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they may take one another upon thoſe termes of not intermedling with each others Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, why may there not be a toleration of different judgements in the family, as well as in the Church, or Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly you ſay, <q>that thoſe profeſſors of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed may not marry with any other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you mean any other Idolaters then themſelves, for all men till by regeneration, they be brought to know God, and ſerve the living God, in his living righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are Idolaters, <hi>Is not Satan the God of this world,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The Covetous man is an Idolater.</hi> Eph. 5.5. So are they that <hi>make their belly their God,</hi> Phil. 3.19. as ſome of the Clergy themſelves do, ſerving their own bellies, and not the Lord Chriſt, and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That they which cauſe diviſious, and offences are of that number,</hi> Rom. 16.17, 18. <hi>All that ſerve the pleaſures and deſires of the fleſh more then God, are Idolaters,</hi> Eph 2.3. Tit. 3.3. may not the people make an Idol of Monarchy, or ſome other Government of a King, a Parliament, of an Army, or any other civil thing?
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115397:152"/>Yea, may not a jealous people, and religious in their way make an Idol of a Shepherd or teacher? See <hi>Zac.</hi> 11.17. may they not make an Idol of an outward day, as outward worſhip or the like; but peradventure, you can eſpie Idolatry no where but in the Maſs, or the worſhiping of Saints, or of Images made of wood, ſtone, gold, ſilver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; if theſe Idolaters be ſo frequent, &amp; ubiquitary, where ſhal the profeſſors of the reformed Religion marry and yet ſhun Idolatrous yoak fellows; muſt they go out of the world as the Apoſtles ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. For thoſe that worſhip the living God in ſpirit and truth are very rare perſons, though ſome ſuch are to be found even among Jews, Turks, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>

                  <p>YOur Doctrine of the Church here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not the ſtate of the Churches, whereof you ſpeak, Section the fifth, ſaying, <q>That the pureſt of them under heaven are ſubject to mixture,</q> and error.</p>
                  <p>Yet in your firſt Section, you begin well with a tolerable deſcription of the univerſal Church in heaven and earth, where notwithſtanding you are miſtaken in making this congregation wholly inviſible which is but ſo in part, and to ſome men.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, in making it to conſiſt of the whole number of the elect, whereas we have proved before that all men are ordained to life, though but conditionally; But if you underſtand by elect thoſe only who are called out of the furnace, and choſen from thence, then is your congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation defective, for infants who dyed in infancy, and are no ſmal part of this bleſſed number, will hereby be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we ſay nothing to your calling of the Church the Spouſe of Chriſt, becauſe ſhe is one of his brides, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all other people the Spouſe of Chriſt, yet there is another thing, which is his firſt, and principal Spouſe; to wit, the Jeruſalem or Kingdom of God, which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from heaven, of which we ſpake before. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2. <hi>And I</hi> John <hi>ſaw the holy City, New Jeruſalem, comming do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In your Second Section you faile much more: Firſt in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115397:154"/>going about to ſpeak of the Catholike Church upon earth, and faſtning upon her a falſ name, and property or adjunct in that you call her <hi>the viſible Church,</hi> wherein beſides that you cloſe with Papiſts in that appellation, you both ſhew your groſs miſtakes, for is the husband inviſible, and the wife viſible? Is the head inviſible, and the body viſible? See John 15.21. <hi>Now all theſe things will they do unto you for my names ſake, becauſe they have not known him that ſent me;</hi> where was that poſſibility of the Church even in the new Teſtament, for the ſpace of 1260. dayes, or yeers; all which time the woman that brought forth the man child Chriſt (which parturient or the Church) did hide her ſelf in the wilderneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if you ſay firſt, "That they are viſible in the body, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, what markes have they in the outward man to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from others, eſpecially from formaliſts and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
                  <p>If you reply again, <hi>That they are viſible and diſcernable to thoſe that have ſpiritual eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer, that even the inviſible God is ſo in ſome meaſure to thoſe men; but this is to make them intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſpiritually diſcernable but not viſible; The work that makes them a Church is inviſible, 1 Cor. 2.15. <hi>But be that is ſpiritual judgeth, or diſcerneth all things;</hi> yet is he judged or diſcerned of none.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In this Section you deſcribe a formal not a true Church, when you make it to conſiſt of men profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Religion, which thing formaliſts and hypocrites may do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas by way of limitation you add pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the true Religion, you ſtill leave us in ſuſpence. For as the true Church fled into the wilderneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. ſo you leave us in a wood to finde her out; for do not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind and ſort of Religious people account their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the true Religion, not only the <hi>Papiſts, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> do ſo in the Weſt, but the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, the <hi>Jews;</hi> yea the <hi>Turkes,</hi> hold their profeſſed Religion to be right.</p>
                  <p>We ſay nothing here of the manifold and different Sects among Chriſtians, each of which maintain their Religion,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115397:155"/>to be the only true Religion, where then ſhall we pitch to finde your true Church.</p>
                  <p>But the true Church, eſpecially that of adult men as the very name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> imports is a Congregation or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of thoſe who are truly called, or in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſanctified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>To the Church which is at Corinth to them that are ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt called to be Saints,</hi> &amp;c. from which we do not exclude the Infants of them or others dying before they ſin actually, ſince our Saviour ſaith expreſly, that, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 10.14. out of which numbers and ſocieties, there is ordinarily no poſſibility of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you build upon a falſe and rotten foundation which you had laid in the former Section. For it is not to that viſible, and formal Church which you deſcribe, but to the congregation of true Saints that God hath given the miniſtery and his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And to thoſe he hath given thoſe offices and gifts, which you will not now admit, as, <hi>ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 4.9, 10, 11. yea, <hi>and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy,</hi> as we have proved before, as the place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But it is true which you ſay in the beginning of your fourth Section, <q>That the Catholike Church hath ſometimes been more viſible,</q> and ſometimes leſs, if you underſtand it of diſcernableneſs, otherwiſe it hath been alwayes invifible to carnal men. And particular Churches as you afterwards there aſſert, are more or leſs pure according as the doctrine of the Church is taught and imbraced, and Gods ordinances adminiſtred; but what you add in the cloſe, concerning the pure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of publick worſhip, is a dream, ſince Chriſt hath appointed none in the new Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>But herein we will joyn with you, if you will alter your words and ſay, <q>So far as the true worſhip of God conſiſting in holineſs,</q> and righteouſneſs of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115397:155"/>truth is obſerved, for that makes a true Church, or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of worſhipers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. <hi>John</hi> 9.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>In your fifth Section, the better to colour over your own faults, as it may ſeem you aſperſe the beſt Churches, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>The pureſt Churches, under heaven are ſubject to mixture and error,</q> what ſay you then to the two Churches, the one of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> Rev. 2.8, 9, 10, 11. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Rev. 3.7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with neither of which Chriſt finds the leaſt fault, but highly commends them both.</p>
                  <p>True it is if we look into the Churches, there is mixture of the inferior members, and they are ſubject to ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but there are preadventure, ſome ſuch members to be found in ſome of thoſe two Churches, if not elſwhere, as are no more ſubject to error then the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were; certain it is there is ſuch a doctrine, &amp; diſcipline from the immediate mouth of God, to be found in one of thoſe Churches, that no reformers have need to ſeek any further, where alſo the true Church is fully diſcovered, and all cauſes of diſcord, and controverſie are in that behalf taken away.</p>
                  <p>But whereas you add in the ſame Section, and that moſt truly, that ſome Churches have ſo degenerated, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no Churches, but Synagogues of Satan, you do here neceſſarily grant, what you elſwhere deny, that ſome of the Saints, and called ones, may fall finally from grace, for none other are the members of the true Church, general or particular among men grown, but ſuch.</p>
                  <p>We will here charge you, with that which you at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and unadviſedly affirm in the cloſe of that Section, <q>That there ſhall be alwayes a Church on earth to worſhip God according to his will,</q> for that implies that the earth and the Church there inhabiting, ſhall continue for ever, which we conceive is no article of your belief.</p>
                  <p>In your ſixth and laſt Section, you truly affirm, "That there is no other head of the Church, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but you in your next words have rather deſerved the Popes Bull then his Benediction, if he may be Judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115397:156"/>For firſt, If a Church be that which yee deſcribe it, A Congregation of thoſe which profeſs the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</p>
                  <p>Why might not the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> a: leaſt wiſe in the Primitive times, before that Church fell away, be in ſome ſence a ſubordinate head of that Church under Chriſt, or an earthly or Eccleſiaſtical head, as <hi>Paul</hi> was over the Churches of the Gentiles. That the Pope ſhould be an Antichriſt (which of many Popes, and of the ſtate of Papacy is and may be truly affirmed) among many other, we grant; but that he, or the ſucceſſion of Popes, or the whole Hierarchy, as they are called, ſhould be that man of ſin, and ſon of perdition which ſitteth in the Temple of God, exalting himſelf, above and againſt all that is called God, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 23.4, 8. is doubtleſs a great, though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſtake: for as to the ſucceſſors of Popes, they are many, but the Antichriſt is one individuum; if they all ſhould periſh, which no charitable man will affirm, they ſhould be called not one ſon of perdition, but ſons of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But to pitch upon the perſon of the Pope, as one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and ſingle Antichriſt, out of ſuch a numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Popes, which will you ſingle out, one paſt, preſent, or to come.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is firſt, that the Antichriſt of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, is a man of ſin, compoſed altogether of iniquity, and not of fleſh, and blood as each Pope is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he is a myſtery of iniquity, into which none but very ſpiritual men can ſee, of which none of you or any of your authors or their adherents have yet a true ſight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Antichriſt exalts himſelf above all that is called God, or is worſhipped, and ſo doth not the Pope directly do, who acknowledgeth God, Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, yea Angels, and Saints to be above him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Antichriſt ſits in the middle of the Temple of God, ſo doth not the Pope in your ſenſe of the Temple, for he pretends to be head of the Roman Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:115397:156"/>Fifthly he doth not ſay, that he is God; as Antichriſt doth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, All Popes came not with ſigns and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor with all the deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, as Antichriſt comes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly Antichriſts coming, is inward, and not outward, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. and deceives all which receive not the love of truth, but the Pope could never decive all ſuch; But what may this Antichriſt be then?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> firſt, the Temple of God is mans heart, or ſoul where he ſits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As Chriſt is the true unction there, ſo Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is a contrary unction, of falſe, and erroneous wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſneſs, and zeal, which ſets it ſelf, as if it were the holy Ghoſt, and his works, oppoſeth the truth, and Kingdom of God, and not only allows, but hides, foſters, and cheriſheth iniquity in men where he raigneth.</p>
                  <p>In a word if the Lord give you ſpiritual eyes to read the two texts, 1. that of 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then that of Revel. 13.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (to both which you refer us) you may by Gods grace, make a diſcovery of Antichriſt, as one neerer you then the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering your ſouls, and learn truly to know and hate him, which mercy the Lord grant unto us all.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt text, you may obſerve theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is evident, that this Antichriſt takes his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and riſe from mens Apoſtacy, or departure from the true faith, love, and godlineſs (which was fet up by Chriſt and his Apoſtles) and that in all that fell away, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. So that he muſt needs be the ſucceeding falſhood, error, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and ungodlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a man compoſed of nothing but ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he muſt therefore needs be a child, yea the ſon of perdition.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That he oppoſeth himſelf to all that is called God, that is to God and all goodneſs, <hi>verſe</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That he exalts himſelf above all that is called God, or worſhipped, even the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115397:157"/>All which is true of the falſe wiſdom and holineſs which Satan begets in men, to delude them there with; and to oppoſe the truth, kingdom, and work of Chriſt thereby.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That he ſits in the temple of God, which is our heart, or inward man.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That there he ſhews, or gives forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a God, as this deceitful work of errour and deluſion, ſaith it is the preſence and work of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, That he cannot well be known, but by ſpiritual revelation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, That there is one tha (what he can) hides him, keeps him cloſe, maskes; covers him, and lets or hinders his revealing, or diſcloſure, and that is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>verſe</hi> 6.7.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, That as he came in by mens departure from Chriſt, his ſpirit, and kingdom; ſo by Chriſts ſpiritual preſence and comming again in his brightneſs, power, and glory, he ſhall be both revealed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ſpirit of his mouth.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That he is called the myſtery of iniquity, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. that is, ſuch a work of iniquity, and error, as paſſeth man for wiſdom, truth and righteouſneſs from above, as many mens faith, religion, and z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al doth this day, which yet is meer deluſion, and from the father of lies.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the wicked one, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which can be no other, then he that is quite oppoſite to the righteous one, even Chriſt; and as Chirſt is the firſt born of God, ſo is this the firſt born, and chief maſter piece of the divel transforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That his coming is not only with lying ſignes, and wonders, but with all deceivableneſs of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obtruding that for truth which is falſhood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, that for vertue, or holineſs, or righteouſneſs, which is iniquity and abomination before God, <hi>verſe</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:115397:157"/>14. Out of the ſame verſe it is clear, that this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is an inward perſon, agent, or evil worker, becauſe it is ſaid that he comes with all deceivableneſs, of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. This Antichriſt is fent by way of wrath, and vengeance upon thoſe that received not the love of the truth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, he is called in the next verſe, the ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Satan, in making them to receive and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve lies.</p>
                  <p>For the other text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11.12, 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may pleaſe to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That this beaſt, the wiſdom and holineſſe of the fleſh ariſeth out of the earth or naturall man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he hath ſome ſemblance of the Lambe, and two hornes with him, with which he will ſeem to puſh againſt ſome ſins of both Tables.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That yet he ſpeaks like the Dragon both againſt all that differ from him in opinion, way, and worſhip, and eſpecially againſt the true Saints of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That he exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt, which is voluptuouſne ſs, or ſenſuality, or the open iniquity, for a falſe holineſs retaines, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines a new, the former corruptions which were in men, without mortifying or reſiſting them to purpoſe, and ſo the laſt beaſt, which is the falſe wiſdome and holineſs aforeſaid, makes men to ſerve and worſhip the firſt beaſt, which was the open or manifeſt iniquity in covetouſneſs, ambition, ſenſuality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Though the former beaſt was wounded by repentance and reformation for a time, and had one of his heads, which is covetouſneſs broken, yet this makes him to live again in men, and cauſeth an Image, or the like reſemblance to the firſt beaſt, to be ſet up in man, yea he gives life, quickning, and power unto it: Thus alſo that firſt wicked beaſt bein; in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wounded by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115397:158"/>Church through the Apoſtacy of men, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and falſe holineſs which crept in, was healed and revived to the full, yea his image hath been more, and more worſhipped to this day.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That this hypocritical beaſt bringeth fire from heaven, that is, he kindles a fiery zeal in men, for the maintaining of their own tenets, and the oppoſing of others, and their devotions, and ſacrifices are often filled with fervency as it were fire from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He cauſeth al that hearken to him, both bond and free, rich and poor, to receive a mark in their right hand, or forehead, which is unrighteouſneſs it ſelf, or unfaithfulneſs in their dealings with God and men, this is the grand mark of the old beaſt, though one peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar mark, whereby this laſt beaſt is known, is enviouſneſs againſt others, <hi>James</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Thus brethren we have given you ſome hints of the true Antichriſt; it is for certain none of Satans leaſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to divert our thoughts, and eys from beholding this Antichriſt within us, and to incenſe us againſt our own fleſh and blood; the Pope or ſome other whom we are commanded to love as our ſelves. Oh how inviſible hath Satan, and his firſt born within us paſſed while he hath directed, and pointed us to a falſe, and imagined Antichriſt, yea ſo far hath he bewitched many, that they can find no Devil to declaim againſt, but the Pope, nor any kingdom of hell, errors, or wicked things, to write, or preach againſt, but the doctrine, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and practiſes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be they right or wrong, wherein notwithſtanding many things are very faulty, but not all that ſome men boggle at or ball againſt.</p>

                  <p>IN your two firſt Sections here you ſpeak poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in your laſt negatively of the communion of Saints, where we hold faire correſpondence w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th you in many things, but not communion with you in all.</p>
                  <p>For firſt you diſtinguiſh not of the ſeveral ages, formes, or degrees of the Saints but joyning them altogether you rather bring in a confuſion, then a true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly you tumble duties and priviledges, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and poſſeſſions together.</p>
                  <p>For firſt as we ſaid before, there are 3 degrees of Saints.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Saints in God the Father, ſuch as are only called and ſanctified by him, which was the common ſtate of the Saints in the old Teſtament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 2.9. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.33, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9. <hi>O fear the Lord all ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are Saints in God the Son, who are called to know him, and believe on him for ſalvation from their ſpiritual enemies, &amp; deliverance from the curſe, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. <hi>To them that are ſanctified by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt and called;</hi> which is the common Claſſis of the Saints in the new Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.6, 7. 1 Cor. 1.2. And thirdly, there are Saints in the holy Ghoſt, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were made in the day of Pentecoſt, when they were filled with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:115397:159"/>Secondly, All thoſe have neither the ſame degree of fellowſhip with God nor with each other, but have their reſpective communion either with the father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone as the firſt, or with the Father and the Son as the ſecond, or with the Holy Ghoſt, alſo, and ſo with the whole Trinity as the third.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> 14.25. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him; If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him,</hi> See 1 John 1.3, 4, 5. And as the Saints have different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of communion with God according to their ſeveral ages, and growth, ſo they all have not alike fellowſhip with each other, in communicating ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guifts; for the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus can condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to thoſe in God the Father, and thoſe in God the Holy Ghoſt can ſtoop to both the other, to do them ſervice, but the firſt cannot communicate much in ſpiritual things to the ſecond, nor either the firſt, or ſecond to the third, though all may in outward things be ſerviceable to each other upon earth. Theſe things premiſed for order, and diſtinction ſake,</p>
                  <p>We finde then in your firſt Section theſe three er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Firſt, That you make none to be Saints, but thoſe that are actually united unto Jeſus Chriſt their head, hereby excluding out of that number, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, all thoſe who as yet are onely bgotten by God the Father as were <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. and many other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You untruly affirm, that all thoſe which are united to Chriſt by his ſpirit and ſaith, have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al communion in his ſufferings, death, reſurrection, and glory; for none of them have fellowſhip in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and glory, till they be dead with him, and that the holy Ghoſt be poured down from Heaven upon them, as he was upon the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. See <hi>Ro.</hi> 6, 5. <hi>For if we have been planted in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11.12. neither have all that beleeved in Chriſt for the preſent,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115397:160"/>proceeded ſo far as to ſuffer with him, and much more to pertake with him in his death, he is a good proficient in Chriſtianitie, that knows what Chriſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th ſuffered in him, and for him, and is come to ſuffer with him, not onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions, but inward ſorrows, in reſiſting temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations without yeelding to them in their ſolicitations, wherein lies the main part of our fellowſhip of Chriſts ſufferings; And as for our becomming wholly dead with Chriſt, you your ſelves hold it, a thing not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attainable in this life, wherin you greatly wrong the grace and power of Chriſt, in his ſaving work and office, and are not onely injurious to others who give ear unto you, but fall ſhort of that happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſalvation enſuing, which is held forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in the Goſpel almoſt everywhere, as hath been ſhewed before, See <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74.75. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. and 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, <hi>&amp;c. Titus</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.7, 11, 17.26, and <hi>Revel</hi> 7.14.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thirdly, you here make no diſtinction betwixt intereſt, and actual communion, where you ſay, <q>That the Saints have communion in each others graces,</q> which is true of the firſt, not of the laſt, where the place which you cited out of <hi>Epbeſ.</hi> 2.5.6. ſpeaks of the Apoſtles high attainments, rather then of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and other common belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section you ſeem tacitely, firſt to imply that there are two ſorts of Saints, the one by profeſſion onely, ſuch as the members of your Church Catholick were in your former Chapter, and ſome that are really ſuch, but we are ſure that the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no Saints for his Church or people, but ſuch as are truely ſanctified, and continuing ſuch he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You truly ſay that Saints are bound to maintain an holy communion in the worſhip of God, but this muſt be underſtood with diverſe limitations to fence it from error.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Secondly, It holds not concerning an outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unleſs the Church ſet up one that is pious, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or lawful, at the leaſt, for Chriſt himſelf hath inſtituted no ſuch worſhip, as we ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Yet muſt all the Saints whereſoever they live, joyn in one true ſpiritual worſhip of the living God, in his living righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We grant notwithſtanding that ſuch as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niontly can come together, ought as frequently as their occaſions and ſafety will bear, to meet together, for the edification, and comfort of each other, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and ſpiritual Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, command ſuch meetings: But the reſidue of this Section about the relief, of the Saints is ſound and good.</p>
                  <p>In your third and negative Section, you truly and upon good grounds diſavow two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Saints are coequal with Chriſt, for no creature in his higheſt perfection can be equal to Chriſt, the one being finite, the other infinite in his divine eſſence.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly that the Communion of Saints upon Earth doth not aboliſh, no nor infringe the title, or propriety which each man hath in his goods and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which is clearly imported in thoſe Scriptures of <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. and <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. which you point us unto, as alſo in many other places of the Old and New Teſtament: But whether that eſtate which the Saints attain at length, when with the Apoſtle they are raiſed up together with Chriſt, and made ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him in the Heavenly places, or things, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5, 6. be a bare quality or accident, or whether it be a ſpiritual life, power and ſubſtance, we will not diſpute; ſure we are the Apoſtle calls it the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and our Saviour, or Wiſdom calls it ſubſtance in one notion or other, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.21. <hi>And I will

                  </head>
                  <p>IN this your general Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you have in a general manner kept the road of truth, though here and there you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate following your miſleading guides, but firſt we allow you the retention, and uſe of the word Sacrament, though not found in the Scriptures, becauſe the thing thereby ſignifyed is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent there, and the term hath not onely been long retained in the Church, but was at the firſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115397:162"/>from a military oath, obligeing the Souldier to obedience and faithfulneſs towards their general, to expreſs our like oligations to God and his Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Then as to your ſeveral Sections, we take no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at all to your ſecond, but muſt crave leave to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie you ſomewhat in moſt of the other.</p>
                  <p>As firſt in the firſt Section, where you ſetting forth the ends of the Sacraments, do put that in the laſt place which was the firſt and principal end of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that is ſolemnly to engage men to the ſervice of God in Chriſt, for it is evident that Circumciſion was ordained for that end mainly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is the Covenant which you ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee, that every man child among you ſhall be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,</hi> Deut. 10.16. <hi>Circumciſe therefore the fore-skin of your heart, and be no more ſtiff-necked;</hi> Jer. 4.4. <hi>Circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord and take away the fore skin of your bearts, ye men of</hi> Judah <hi>and inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem; the like we finde written concerning the Paſſover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.17. <hi>And ye ſhall obſerve the feaſt of unleavened bread, for in this ſelf-ſame day have I brought your armies out of the land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>therefore ſhall ye obſerve this day in your generatious for ever,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.8. <hi>Therefore let us keep the feaſt not with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth.</hi> And as the Sacraments of the Old, ſo thoſe of the New Teſtament are inſtituted, to inſtruct us in duty alſo.</p>
                  <p>Hence Baptiſm is called the Baptiſm of Repentance, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. And Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Lords ſupper ſaith, <hi>do ye this in remembrance of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. and verſe 26. <hi>As oft as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ſhew ye the Lords death till his coming.</hi> viz. That ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual coming which he promiſed. <hi>John</hi> 14.19.23. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we do not deny, but that ſpiritual benefits are to be expected in the performance of theſe duties; ſo the repentance taught by Baptiſm hath remiſſion of ſins annexed to it, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. and the ſpiritual body and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115397:163"/>blood of Chriſt, of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in the 29. chapter, are in the Sacraments of the Lords Supper aſſured to thoſe that are mindful of his death, and ſuffer with him in reſiſting temptations, by which they are enabled to hold out, and overcome when they are tempted: but theſe benefits are ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſealed unto us but conditionally, and in the ſecond place onely.</p>
                  <p>Your third uſe, of that diſtinction between the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God and the world, we alſo allow; but you have omitted one main end which the Lord had in inſtituting the Sacraments, which was thus even by degrees to build up his Tabernacles of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was fallen down; to wit, the firſt part of it in Circumciſion, the ſecond in the Paſſover, as alſo in the Lords Supper, and the third in his breathing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſciples, and ſaying unto them; <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 20 22. For which laſt end, both the feaſt of weeks in the Old Teſtament, and Baptiſm in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, were inſtituted in the new, eſpecially that third part of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas you ſay in your third Section, "That the efficacy of a Sacrament doth not depend at all upon the piety and good intention of him that doth adminiſter it, you therein ſpeak very unadviſedly; For wheras the efficacy of a Sacrament is either oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto duty, or the aſſurance of grace and help, are not both obſtructed by him that adminiſters it, if he be ignorant and not able to declare the Myſtery of the Sacrament, or if he adminiſters the ſame in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and abſurd manner, or to other ends then it is ordained for, or being a wicked perſon hath his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for efficacy rejected? And on the contrary do not the ſpiritual abilities of the Miniſter, his piety and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent payers conduce much both to the edifying of the people in that ſervice, and the drawing down a bleſſing upon himſelf and them therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:115397:163"/>Thirdly, Though we muſt grant you in the fourth Section, that there are but two proper and compleat Sacraments in the New Teſtament, yet there are many as it were, ſemi Sacraments, to be found there, which are holy ſignes inſtituted by God in the time of the Goſpel or before, of which ſome repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our duties, ſome the grace of God, and ſome both; ſuch is the waſhing and wiping of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples feet, <hi>John</hi> 13.4, 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The anointing with oyl, ſuch as were ſick, and to be healed by the Diſciples, and Elders of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Mark 6.13. <hi>And they caſt out many Devils, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with oyl thoſe that were ſick, and healed them,</hi> James 5.14. <hi>Is any man ſick among you let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oyl in the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Impoſing of hands in a threefold caſe; Firſt, In the way of healing, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. <hi>They ſhall lay their hands upon the ſick, and they ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In confirming new Diſciples, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.6.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, In ordaining either Deacons, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. or Biſhops themſelves, 1 <hi>Tymothy</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tymothy</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The near union betwixt the Husband and the wife, with their reciprocal duties, figuring forth Chriſt and his Church, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2.21—24.2.19, 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25—32.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Some adhere the Ceremony of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands praying, and propheſying with his head un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; becauſe a cover is a token of uncleanneſs, and he repreſents Chriſt the Head of the Church, who is holy and pure; but of the Wives praying, and ſitting to hear Propheſyings with their head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, both in token of ſubjection, and to ſhew that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115397:164"/>the man her Head, is through the fall unclean; which things is now neither obſerved nor regarded in the reformed Churches: See <hi>Corinthians</hi> 11.2—16. Yet let us conſider adviſedly, whether the Apoſtle would ſpend half a Chapter about a needleſs thing which might be obſerved, or omitted at pleaſure: To thoſe perhaps ſome might be added.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, whereas you ſay here in this fourth Section, <q>That the two Sacraments of the Goſpel were both inſtituted by Chriſt our Lord.</q> You are much miſtaken; for though the Lords Supper was ſo, yet Baptiſm was ordained by God the Father, who ſent <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt by his Doctrine and Baptiſm, to make way for Chriſt his Doctrine and Office, <hi>John</hi> 1.33.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, You truly affirm in the cloſe of the ſame Section, <q>That neither of theſe two Sacraments may be diſpenſed by any, but by a Miniſter of the Word lawfully called:</q> But here we pray you conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of it, whether the bare calling of man be he the Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Governour, or both, be a ſufficient commiſſion to diſpenſe the Word and Sacraments by? Perhaps in a formal Church of Profeſſors the whole Frabrick being humane it may ſuffice, but to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter theſe among the Saints, and houſhold of God, who onely are the true Church, as we ſaid before; peradventure it requires an higher call, even Gods own authority, or commiſſion, as the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to which you point, or ſome of them plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, to wit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Heb</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Whereas you ſay in you fifth and laſt Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <q>That the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament were in regard of the things ſignified,</q> for ſubſtance the ſame with theſe of the New, it is not every way true; for circumciſion the initiatory Sacrament in the Old Teſtament did ſet forth the firſt part of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſpecially, but Baptiſm in, or unto the name of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115397:164"/>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, repreſents all the three parts of the new birth: and the Paſſover, though it imported to eat Chriſts fleſh, yet it was ordinarily but a communicating in one kinde, whereas the Lords Supper communicates in both kindes, and holds forth the Blood of Chriſt, as well as his fleſh for the ſtrengthening of thoſe that follow Chriſt into his death.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115397:166"/>other which we admitted before; if that Miniſter be called of God thereunto, to adminiſter this Sacrament to his Diſciples; otherwiſe we doubt whether his commiſſion be authentique in the true Church, and the congregations of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>But what you write further in that ſecond Section, "That the Element to be uſed in this Sacrament, is water; is true, nor is there any other Element to be uſed, nor is any other compoſition, or ſophiſtication needful. Notwithſtanding you are here two wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In not ſhewing what the Element ſignifies, nor ſecondly, how we are to be baptized in relation to the Trinity, either inwardly or outwardly aright.</p>
                  <p>But to make a ſupply for your defects; The water of Baptiſm ſignifies the pure Doctrine, or Word of God, as hath been partly intimated before. <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now are ye clean through the word that I have ſpoken unto you</hi> John 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> Epheſ 5.25.26. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word:</hi> Thus we muſt be born again, not of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alone, but of Water and the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe that are duly baptized, muſt be baptized <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> not <hi>in</hi> the name onely, but <hi>to</hi> the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.19, 20. That is, to carry the name, or the like being firſt of the Father; then of the Son, and laſtly of the Holy Ghoſt</p>
                  <p>The firſt, In a love to all good, and hatred to all evil.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, In carrying the ſaving power of Chriſt as a conqueſt over, and preſervative againſt the power of ſin and Satan.</p>
                  <p>And the third, In fruition of all truth, light, life, gifts and comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, wherein the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115397:167"/>Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcending from above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtles were ſent by Chriſt: Firſt with their doctrine, and then with water to baptize men, that they might be fitted to receive, &amp; carry the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold name, which yet in the end is but one name, and like being of the living God, according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of creatures.</p>
                  <p>In the third Section you have ſome pretty ſprinkling of Truth, where you maintain, and that truly <q>That dipping,</q> or ducking in the Water is not neceſſary in this Sacrament, but that effuſion, or ſprinkling with water will ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>But in your fourth Section, where you ſay, <q>That the infants of one,</q> or both beleeving parents are to be baptized, your aſſertion is too far dipped in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; For Infants are no where commanded to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the new Teſtament, though the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were commanded at the eighth day to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, nor doth Baptiſm ſucceed circumciſion in that behalf, or almoſt in any other reſpect, unleſs it be firſt as an initiatory Sacrament, for new converts. And ſecondly, ſo far as it is a Baptiſm in the name of the Father, or of the Father and the Son at the uttmoſt; for Baptiſm in the Holy Ghoſt points at a far higher eſtate, then either Circumciſion or the Paſſover, or yet the ſupper of the Lord hold forth: yet we do not deny but Infants may lawfully be baptized, even the Infants of unbeleeving parents, if ſome friends of theirs deſire it, and the ſuperiour powers ſo appoint, becauſe the Baptiſm of Infants is no where forbidden, and though in regard of innate uncleanneſs they have no great need of outward, or inward waſhing from ſin, as we have proved before; yet this Sacrament being adminiſtred in infancy, and afterward known to the party baptized, may be as uſeful to him in the way of inſtruction and comfort, when after his fall he would return to the Lord, as circumciſion was
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115397:167"/>to the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> which was adminiſtred in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>
                  <p>Your fifth Section preſents the neglect, or contempt of this ordinance as a great ſin, which is true of new converts, who ſhould not onely admit of it being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but even ſeek and deſire it where it may be had, as the Eunuch did, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36.37. But this is not alike true of infants who cannot deſire it, nor have need of it for the preſent; nor yet of their parents in relation to them, unleſs it be in theſe Countries, and places where the Governors appoint all infants to be baptized; for here to neglect or contemn, it is a ſin of contumacy againſt theſe Governours: and though ſome ſcruple at it, becauſe they cannot finde Poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme to be Gods Ordinance, yet they ought to ſubmit to it as an Humane, or Eccleſiaſtical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, eſpecially ſince obedience to Governors is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded, and the baptizing of Infants no where prohibited.</p>
                  <p>The reſidue of that your fifth Section is very ſound and good, for you truely and rightly affirm, <q>That grace and ſalvation are not ſo inſeparably annexed unto baptiſm, as that no perſon can be regenerated, or ſaved without it, or that all that are baptized, are undoubtedly regenerated.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your ſixth Section concerning the efficacy of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, not being tyed to the very moment of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is true oft his and all other Sacraments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we underſtand the grace held forth onely as you ſeem to do, not without a great miſtake, or the duty we ſhould learn from it, and them which is no ſmall part of the drift, and efficacy of the Sacraments, as hath been declared.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly; Whereas you ſay in your ſeventh and laſt Section, <q>That Baptiſm is but once to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto any perſons;</q> it may be either true or falſe, as it is underſtood; for theſe Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus</hi> which had not ſo much as heard that there was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115397:168"/>Ghoſt, were baptiſed into <hi>Johus</hi> Baptiſm; <hi>Acts</hi> 19.3. when they had heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach unto them, were baptized again, <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. ſo doubtleſs were many more of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, for though <hi>John</hi> made mention of one that ſhould come after him, <hi>And baptize his Diſciples with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire, Mat.</hi> 3.11. Yet he baptized them in the name of the Father, or but unto the name of Son at the furtheſt, and not unto the Holy Ghoſt, from which eſtate, his office and baptiſme ſtood at too great a diſtance, in that his fore-running office; yet it is true, that thoſe who are compleatly baptized in, or unto the name of the Father, the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt, need not to be baptized again: Howbeit two things would further be enquired into.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whether the Apoſtle did not make ſome pauſe in the baptizing, naming each perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in whoſe name they baptized, and ſo pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a while betwixt the firſt and the ſecond, and then betwixt the ſecond and the third; becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſmes, Hebrews</hi> 6.2. as alſo for that ſome were ſaid to be <hi>Baptized for the dead,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 15.29. the former of which places implies, that the acts of Baptiſm might be a plurality, though all at one time ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively performed.</p>
                  <p>The other, That ſome were Baptized to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead with Chriſt, (which we take to be the genuine meaning of that Text) and that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizer there pauſed, if he went any further at that time.</p>
                  <p>The other is, Whether thoſe that were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what was done to them in their Infancy by death of Parents, or Sureties, may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be Baptized again at the time of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Converſion to God; and that for their further edification, or comfort, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we neither ſee what neceſſity there can be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115397:168"/>of Perſons once Baptized, and knowing they were ſo, to be rebaptized, or what warrant the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts have from God or men, to reiterate this Sacrament, or adminiſter it at all.</p>

                  <p>To return then to the buſineſs in hand, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other great miſtakes of yours in this argument, you plainly and fully diſcover to the whole world, that you underſtand not the myſtery either of the Cup, or of the Bread and Wine, which are the true body and blood of Chriſt in this Sacrament, nor yet the main end of its inſtitution, and ſo upon the matter you are not leſs, but more groſly deceived then the Jews were, <hi>John</hi> 6.52, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For our Saviour ſpeaking unto them there of his fleſh, which he would give for the <hi>life of the world</hi> verſe 51. and of the neceſſity of <hi>eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, if they would have life,</hi> verſe 53. and of the excellency and uſefulneſs of his <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> verſe 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58. The Jews under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſame fleſh and blood of Chriſt which you do here, even thoſe of his humanity; but herein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded you, whereas corporal things can be no ways eaten but corporally, they conceived and that rightly, that if it were his humane fleſh and blood that they muſt feed of, they muſt Canibal like eat and drink the ſame; but you hold that the ſame muſt be eaten by Faith, that is, by conceit and imagination, and no otherwiſe; for bodily things muſt be eaten, and drunk
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115397:171"/>in a bodily manner, and with bodily organs, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things may be taken in ſpiritually by Faith.</p>
                  <p>We pray you therefore to read this chapter adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>and the Lord give you a right underſtanding in all things.</hi> Where if the Lord remove the ſcales from your eyes, you may obſerve theſe things with us.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt perceiving this their literal, and groſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of his doctrine concerning his fleſh, to be eaten and blood to be drunk, doth at the 63. <hi>verſe</hi> explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that firſt negatively, and then poſitively, telling them, <hi>That the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here you ſee that it is not his humane fleſh and blood that he gives us to feed upon, and that by his own teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he ſaith, that <hi>unleſs we eat of his fleſh, and drink of his blood, we neither have nor can have life in us,</hi> verſ. 53. but Infants, and all thoſe that never heard of Chriſt in the fleſh, cannot eat of it in your ſenſe, that is, by faith or imagination; whence it will follow according to your Doctrine and conceiving; that they cannot poſſibly have life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Our Saviour ſaith verſe 56. <hi>He that cateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him;</hi> which you cannot verifie of all thoſe that eat his fleſh and drink his blood in your ſenſe, and according to your doctrine, and conceiving; for we finde many rejected by our Saviour and ſhut out of his Kingdom, who had eaten and drunk in his preſence, <hi>Luke</hi> 3 25, 26, 27. but it is moſt true of the ſpiritual fleſh and blood eaten and drunken rightly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That his fleſh is a bread that came down from Heaven,</hi> verſe 58. But his humane
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115397:172"/>fleſh, and conſequently his blood came not from thence.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Our Saviour implies that this food muſt be both inward and living, in thoſe words, verſe 57. <hi>As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me ſhall live by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To eat theſe, is to eat Chriſt: If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand then, <hi>What is that fleſh of Chriſt that is broken for us, and which blood of Chriſt is it that is here ſignified?</hi> We anſwer to each diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The fleſh of Chriſt is his Word, whereby the inviſible Word the Deity is made in ſome ſort viſible and edible unto us; thus Chriſt the Eternal Word was made <hi>fleſh to his Diſciples and dwelt among them,</hi> John 1.14. And they afterward ſaw his glory, as of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, when he was ſpiritually incarnate in and with them. Thus he told us before by way of explanation of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. what was the fleſh that he would have the Jewes and us to feed upon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his <hi>Words, which are ſpirit and life.</hi> Thus <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of the eating of this word or fleſh, chap. 15. verſe 16. <hi>Thy words were found by me, and I did eat them, And they word was unto me the joy and rejoycing of my heart:</hi> Thus <hi>Origen</hi> among the other Ancients ſaith, <hi>Chriſtiani omni die carnis agni comedunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chriſtians eat of the fleſh of the Lamb every day, whilſt they feed of the fleſh of the Word of God;</hi> This is that Manna from Heaven which is Angels food, Pſal. 103.20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord ye his Angels that excel in ſtrength, that do his Commandements, bearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the voice of his word,</hi> of which the Manna in the wilderneſs was a type, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.24, 25. <hi>He raigned down Manna upon them, and gave them of the Corn of Heaven; Thus man did eat Angels food, he ſent them meat to the full.</hi> All which is more truly to be underſtood of the word wherewith God fed both them, and the Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, then of the outward manna which was but a ſhadow of it, Nor was it unuſual in the old or new
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115397:172"/>Teſtament, to expreſs the word of God, the food of our ſouls by bread. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And he humbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with Manna which thou knoweſt not, neither did thy Fathers know: That he might make thee know, that man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man live;</hi> where by the way the ſpiritual myſtery both of Manna and of bread is opened, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the daies come that I will ſend a famine in the Land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the word of the Lord:</hi> where obſerve this word is no other but that which comes out of the mouth of the Lord, or is ſpoken by his ſpirit, for otherwiſe how would it be ſo ſcarce and hard to be found, as follows in the next verſe, <hi>And they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not finde it; In that day ſhall the young men, and the fair Virgins faint for thirſt,</hi> but the written word, with the comments and expoſitions of men thereupon, never was any hard thing to come by; it was then true in the former ſenſe onely which is written, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>And the word of the Lord was precious, in thoſe daies there was no open viſion:</hi> And as the word of God thus ſpoken is compared to bread in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. ſo is it likewiſe in the New, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.4. <hi>But he anſwered; it is written that man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> As man then hath a twofold life, ſo he muſt live by a twofold bread.</p>
                  <p>Thus for the myſtical fleſh of Chriſt, his Blood here is that which came from Heaven, as well as his Fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 6.58. and which is <hi>Spirit, and Life,</hi> for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and quickning of our Souls; and this is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the life, and power, and ſpirit of Chriſt, whereby our corruptions are put away and removed ſignified by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and our ſpiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. of which you heard before out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115397:173"/>Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God; purge your Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God:</hi> out of Heb. 10.29. <hi>Of how much ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> out of Heb. 13.20, 21. <hi>Now the very God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will:</hi> For what is it we pray you, but this life or ſpirit of Chriſt, that purgeth our ſoul or conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God, or that ſanctifieth us, or makes us perfect in every good work? This is the firſt blood of the New Teſtament, as we have proved before, It was by this blood that the beleeving Jews to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, were redeemed or delivered from their vain converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. It was with this blood that the Saints had waſhed their robes, and made them white, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. to which places we added 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.8. which makes the water, the blood, and the ſpirit to agree in one: Theſe are the fleſh, and blood of Chriſt held forth in this Sacrament, as things ſpoken of before, <hi>John</hi> 6. This fleſh or word of Chriſt had been often broken by him, and given to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to eat; this blood of Chriſt had been given them to take in, and drink. <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you,</hi> 1 Cor: 12.13. <hi>And ye have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> where the Myſtery of the wine adminiſtred, and blood ſpoken of in that Sacrament is expounded, as it is alſo by our Saviour at the time of inſtitution in theſe words of his, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28, 29. <hi>But I ſay unto you I will not henceforth drink of the fruit of the Vine, until that day that I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where for the better diſcovery of your own former
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115397:173"/>miſtakes, you may obſerve two things in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt ſpeaks not of a body in the future tenſe, that ſhould be broken for them, but one that was then broken for them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That in the preſent tenſe likewiſe, he ſpeaks of a blood then poured out, as his ſpirit had been in ſome meaſure upon them, and not of a blood to be wholy ſhed, or poured out for the future onely.</p>
                  <p>This fleſh and blood of Chriſt, is a good Mediatour betwixt us and God, to pull down the partition wall of ſin, and ſlay the enmity betwixt us and him, and the ſpecial means of our conqueſt, as we ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>
                  <p>Yet far be it from us as we ſaid before, That we ſhould deny the uſe and benefit of Chriſts Humane fleſh, and blood, who was made of the ſeed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> according to the promiſes, and ſuffered for us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, and therein did not onely ſet us an example, and monument of what he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſuffered for us, and in us, but alſo chalked out the true way to eternal life, yea, paid an invalluable price for our Redemption from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27, 28. Yea, we ſhewed before, that if the fallen man were made perfect again in the way of regeneration, yet without the ſacrifice and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, he could not be ſaved from the guilt, and puniſhment of his ſins: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>For by one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath he perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> But this is the thing which we here aſſert, that the fleſh of Chriſt which he commands us to eat, and the blood which he enjoyns us to drink in this Sacrament, are not thoſe of his humanity, as you, and your guides have hitherto taught, but that very fleſh and blood which came from Heaven by our Saviours own doctrin, <hi>John</hi> 6. aforeſaid confirmed with many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor is it the cuſtome of the Lord to figure out
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115397:174"/>corporal things, but ſpiritual by outward, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Elements and Types.</p>
                  <p>And as you, with your Teachers have not had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true fight of thoſe bleſſed Myſteries, ſo have you not underſtood the Myſtery of the Cup or Chalice, out of which the Spirit and life of Chriſt, or the blood of the new Teſtament is to be received and drunk; which Cup is firſt the ſuffering or Paſſion of Chriſt, as we ſee in that his prayer, <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me;</hi> and then our like ſuffering for him, and with him both in the outward man, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man alſo; and that eſpecially in the reſiſtance of temptation, and the enduring of the enemies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and vexation, <hi>Matthew</hi> 20.22, 23. <hi>Are ye able to drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptiſm, wherewith I ſhall be baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to take a ſhort ſurvey of your ſeveral Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt of them you miſtake the ends for which the Sacrament was inſtituted, which was not to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or ſtrengthen our ſouls with his humane fleſh and blood, or to make the ſame the band or pledge of our communion with him, and each other, nor to ſeal up the benefits of his Sacrifice upon the Croſs, but to hold out in a myſtery, and exhibite unto us a ſpiritual <hi>verticum,</hi> wereby we may be inabled to keep a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paſſover with him from death to life, and become the more ſtrengthened to follow him in his like ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and death, and ſo to be better armed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt all encounters of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a meat offering, and drink offering, to ſhew that we muſt be furniſhed with the body and blood of Chriſt, to help us in the ſacrificing and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up our ſpiritual ſacrifice of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Melchizedek</hi> met <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was weary and faint with his late fight, and brought him bread and wine to revive and ſtrengthen him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:115397:174"/>Thus furniſhed, we ought to remember and ſhew forth the Lords death till his comming to us in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 26. and by eating of this one bread, we alſo become one bread, or fleſh or bread with Chriſt, and each other, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and ſo this Sacrament without all controverſie was ordained as you ſpeak afterwards, to oblige us unto duty, and to further our communion with Chriſt and with each other, that we may be made one bread, and one body with him, and in him; yet not in your ſenſ or way, but as St <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.16, 17. by being all made pertakers of one bread, to wit, his word, and 1 <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> 12.13. by being all made to drink into one ſpirit, as before it was ſhewed at large.</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section you truely ſay, <q>That in this Sacrament, Chriſt is not offered up to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a ſacrifice for the quick and the dead, but Chriſt here offereth himſelf in his Myſtical fleſh and blood, as a true meat offering, and drink offering to his true beleevers,</q> and followers; nor is it advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſaid of you there, <q>That at or in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is no real ſacrifice at all made, beſide the commemoration of his own offering of himſelf, with all poſſible praiſe to God for the ſame;</q> for in the right celebration of this Supper, we ought to offer up both the ſacrifices of <hi>a broken, and contrite heart, Pſal.</hi> 51.17. and to ſacrifice the remainder of our ſins as our daily offering in the holy of Gods Tabernacle, in true conformity to Chriſt, and through the help of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fleſh, and blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. yet it is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and not his ſacrifice, that is the alone propitiation for all men, <hi>John</hi> 12.1.2.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you ſet forth ſome of the duties of the perſon who is to adminiſter this Sacrament truly, but you have omitted the many parts of his office, which are to declare the time, and ends of its inſtitution, with the holy myſteries which it ſignifies, and to ſtir up the people to lay hold of theſe benefits,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115397:175"/>and to follow Chriſt unto the death, with ſutable prayers and thankſgivings.</p>
                  <p>In your fourth Section you truly affirm, "That the Prieſt, or Miniſter ſhould not obſerve, or take this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alone, and that he ſhould communicate in both kindes to the true beleevers and followers of Chriſt, and you do not without cauſe deny pompous elevations of, and proceſſions with the hoſt for ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſake, and other ſuperſtitious reſervations and abuſes of the bread or hoſt.</p>
                  <p>In your fifth you miſtake much, ſaying, <q>That the Elements in their ſignification,</q> have relation to Chriſt crucified, as we have ſhewed before. Yet it is true, that the names of the Elements, are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the body and blood of Chriſt, which they are deſigned to repreſent, but the predication is Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental as you ſpeak, and lies in the verbe ſubſtantive <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is likewiſe true which you there affirm, <q>That the Elements even after conſecration remain for nature and ſubſtance,</q> bread and wine ſtill.</p>
                  <p>In your ſixth Section you juſtly tax and refute the Doctrine of Popiſh tranſubſtantiation, and might have reproved the conſubſtantiation of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> alſo upon good grounds; but if that thoſe terms, or phraſes were uſed to teach us, that we muſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conſubſtantiated with Chriſts body and blood aforeſaid, or tranſubſtantiated into the ſame, it might paſs in a good ſenſe of ſpiritual conformity.</p>
                  <p>In your ſeventh Section you comfort your ſelves, and your worthy receivers with vain words, and hopes concerning the preſence, not real only, but ſpiritual, alſo of that body and blood of Chriſt, which were never ſignified by this Sacrament; ſo that herein the Papiſts, Lutherans, and Calviniſts, do <hi>litigate de lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HERE Brethren if we firſt agree what the true Church is, that have power to cenſure, and then who are thoſe Governours or Superiours in whoſe hand eſpecially that power lies, we ſhall not we hope be thought over cenſorious in other things.</p>
                  <p>It is true then which you ſpeak in the firſt Section, "That the Lord Jeſus is King and head of his Church, and of no other, though the Lord of all creatures; and ſuch an head he is both of the univerſal Church, whether upon Earth alone, or in Heaven alſo, and of each particular Church, yea, of every member of thoſe Churches, which are in Chriſt, or are brought to beleeve on him, obey and ſerve him in holineſs, and righteouſneſs of truth; but thoſe Saints or Churches which are onely begotten in God the Father, and not as yet taught, &amp; led to the Son, have the Father only for their Head, and king for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:115397:177"/>It is true alſo, That Chriſt appointed a Government diſtinct from that of the Civil Magiſtrate, in, and for his true Church, which conſiſts not of formaliſts, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſors for the greateſt part, but of true Saints which obey and follow Chriſt daily in his active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience; but he hath ordained no ſuch thing in his Goſpel for national and viſible Churches, whoſe religion ſtands in outward profeſſions, and formalities; mainly, or onely.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the outward Government of ſuch Churches, whether Epiſcopal or Presbyterian, or mixt of both, are but prudential and humane, although it is evident out of both the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that to <hi>Titus,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures, that there ought to be not onely a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or joynt ſociety of Elders in compleat congregations of ſuch Saints, but if they be great, a ſuperintendent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over them, if we will follow the conſtitution, and patern of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, in the pure Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches, ſo that both theſe in their right State were <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is not to be denied that this Government is left, or to be placed in the hands of ſome ſpecial mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or ſociety of the Churches, rightly called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; but we rather call thoſe Governours, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers with the Apoſtles, then Officers as you do; for that word among Governours, ſignifies Agents, Inſtruments, and Miniſters under others, or inferiours rather then Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours. Howbeit, Chriſt hath thouſands of Saints in ſeveral nations, which living diſperſedly here and there, either conveniently cannot, or actually do not reduce themſelves into one or more Congregations, and ſo want the benefit of that Government, and other means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and edification likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>And this is the common ſtate of the Saints in Europe, and elſewhere, who nevertheleſs are members of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and true Church of Chriſt; we know notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are ſome Congregations that by conſent meet together, and erect a Government among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the greateſt part of which are but formaliſts, and as their Doctrines and Adminiſtrations are none of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115397:177"/>pureſt, ſo their Government is but arbitrary, or pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall alſo.</p>
                  <p>But here Brethren you are very defective in three things among others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In not ſhewing what Officers, or Governours each true Congregation in Chriſt ſhould have.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By whom they ſhould be choſen.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, By whom the reſpective cenſures of the Church ſhould be adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, we find, That a compotent congregation in one City or place had their Elders, as Teachers, Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and Rulers appointed over them, <hi>Act</hi> 14.23. <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> &amp;c. we read alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 6.16. That when the number of the Diſciples was increaſed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſome of the widows had been neglected in the daily miniſtration of almes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions, there were <hi>Deacons men of honeſt report, and full of the holy Ghoſt, and of wiſdom,</hi> choſen to be both trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and diſpenſers of the almes, and ſo were aſſiſtants to the Apoſtles, and Elders of the Church in providing for the poor eſpecially; yet did they upon occaſion declare the true Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt alſo.</p>
                  <p>And afterward in the abſence of the Apoſtles, there were ſuperintendent Biſhops, ſet over the great Churches, as <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 21.18. <hi>And the day following,</hi> Paul <hi>went in, or unto</hi> James, <hi>and all the Elders were preſent;</hi> and <hi>Tymothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appears out of the tenor of both the Epiſtles writ unto him by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the ſubſcription to the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>And finally, <hi>Titus</hi> over the Churches in <hi>Crete</hi> a very ſpacious Iland, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond thing, the Elders and Officers of the Church are not to be choſen by the congregation, but by the Superiours both in growth and place, and ſuch as were firſt called and choſen by the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained Elders in all the Churches, which they had converted as before, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. and the ſuperintendent Biſhops had the ſame power, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Greet, <hi>that thou ſhouldſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115397:178"/>in every City.</hi> See 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. throughout, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.22. And though the Apoſtles gave leave to the congregation to chuſe out wiſe and faithful men, of which things they could judge, to be truſted with the keeping and diſpenſing of the treaſures of the Church under themſelves eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as almoners, yet they gave them that authority by laying their hands upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Nor doth it follow from hence, that the Congregation of Saints, ſhould chooſe their Teachers and Elders, and much leſs that the Vulgar in every Pariſh ſhould make their Election of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, for then there would be many a weak, if not a wild and mad choice in too many places or Pariſhes.</p>
                  <p>As to the third, the Elders are to be admoniſhed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked by the Biſhop, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.1, 19, 20. the Elders are to be ſuſpended by thoſe who ordained them; to wit, the Biſhop, and Presbytery, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.6. The common people are to be admoniſhed according to their ſeveral ages, and degrees, either by the Biſhop, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.1, 2, 3 or by the other rulers and Elders.</p>
                  <p>Or finally, By the Congregation, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.14, 15. but excommunication, or delivering up to Satan, ſhould be executed by the whole body though conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon by the Biſhop and Elders firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.4.5. and the like we ſay of abſolution, or receiving into the Church again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 21.12.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, we may admit that which you ſpeak of the committing of the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven in your ſecond Section; to wit, to Elders and Governours called of God, but not of man alone; but that remitting, and retaining of ſins is both miniſterial under the Lord Jeſus, and principally placed in the Church repreſentative, or the Superiours and Elders act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gods ſpirit, and both fitted and called to that high office, <hi>Mathew</hi> 16.19. <hi>Mathew</hi> 18.17, 18. <hi>John</hi> 20.20, 21.22.</p>
                  <p>In your third Section you lay down good grounds, why there ſhould bee Eccleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We grant likewiſe that ſuch ordinary miniſters and perſons may be ſent from their own to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet can they act onely within their own Sphere, as rational, learned, or devout perſons, not as inſpired men: But that ordinary miniſters may by their office when the Magiſtrate is an enemy, call each other or aſſemble into a publick Synod, we doubt, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they may meet privately, and adviſe, yea, pray together.</p>

For our parts we acknowledge that the Saints in Heaven do obtain no ſmall acceſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, as of light and wiſdom, ſo of power, love, holineſs, peace, and joy alſo; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>For me to live is Chriſt, but to die is gain,</hi> To which that ſeems to agree which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>For we know that if our earthly Tabernacle of this houſe were diſſolved, we have a building given us of God not made with hands, but eternal in the Heavens.</hi> But that the body of ſin may, and ſhould be deſtroyed, the workmanſhip of Satan aboliſhed, the righteouſneſs of the law fulfilled, and the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that comes down from Heaven, be fully ſought and attained by us through the grace of Chriſt even in this life, we have ſufficiently proved before. It remains then that we all take heed to the Apoſtles charge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 1.2. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and the ſpirit, perfecting our holineſs in the fear of God; yea, let all thoſe that would be counted faithful Miniſters in Chriſt Jeſus labour with St.</hi> Paul Coloſ. 1.28. <hi>to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to your 2d. Section although the Apoſtle in that great &amp; larger chapter of the reſurrection, 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15. ſeems to ſpeak onely of the reſurrection of the juſt, yet we
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115397:183"/>muſt grant that all the dead ſhall be raiſed according to other Scriptures and namely that of <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Marvel not at this for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the reſurrection of condemnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for a concluſion of this chapter may not ſome be miſtaken in thinking the firſt reſurrection which comes not to any till they be firſt dead with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 5. is paſt already, ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. yea, to make our future happineſs ſure, what had been more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here, then for you to have preſſed the neceſſity of the firſt reſurrection for all fallen and corrupted men, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath his part in the firſt reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His argument <hi>de rebus noviſſimis</hi> is a good ſubiect for you and us to cloſe with, but as you want ſome light in the beginning, ſo we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your diſcerning or Judgement in your end. You by your Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to which you referr us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding ſo many kinds and times of Judgment, very different in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you might have obſerved that Chriſts office of Judicature is twofold, the one in the Saints, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115397:185"/>the other outward over all perſons of Angels and men.</p>
                  <p>The former of theſe, his inward and ſpiritual office Chriſt executes two wayes at two diſtant times, yea, in two ſeveral degrees.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is when he judgeth betwixt them and their ſpiritual enemies, and not only delivers his ſervants from them, but guideth and ruleth them according to his Lawes and Will.</p>
                  <p>Thus as types of Chriſt, <hi>Othnicl, Gedion, Jephtha,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of old were ſaid to judge <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſutably hereunto <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks thus of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.4. <hi>He ſhall judge the poor of his people, he ſhall ſave the children of the needy, and break in peices the oppreſſors,</hi> and Chriſt himſelf ſaith, John 12.31. <hi>Now is the judgement of this world, now is the Prince of this world caſt out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſts ſecond way of judging in his Saints, is when he riſeth up in them in fulneſs of light and power, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are dead with him; in which day and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his he manifeſts unto them truth and errour, light and darkneſs, life and death, yea, every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of their own hearts, even as the light of the Sun laies all open to the eye, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Therefore judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God for this very cauſe;</hi> the Apoſtle would have all men forbear judging till that time, but not until the general day of judgment; now the outward judging of Chriſt is either in this life or the other; in this life he judgeth and puniſheth perſons, nations, yea, and ſometimes the whole earth, as he did in the daies of <hi>Noah.</hi> After this life he firſt judgeth every man at his death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.27. <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after that cometh the judgement,</hi> and then as you have here ſet it forth all men and Angels at or in the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>Thus then is a manifold day or time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115397:185"/>judgement ſpoken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and 25. Chapters, and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His particular coming to every man at his death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His coming to judge and puniſh the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.23. which came to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 38 yeers after his death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His coming to puniſh the falſ, proud and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of the Gentiles, a work now in hand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.3, 20, 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſts inward and ſpiritual coming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.19, 20. and ſpoken of 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36, 37. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7. which ſpiritual coming of his was after a time to ceaſe in the Church, by reaſon of mens Apoſtacy, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture away from the true faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.12. <hi>The daies will come when ye ſhall deſire to ſee one of the daies of the Son of man, and ſhall not ſee them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There is Chriſts ſecond coming, and his ſpiritual entrance into his Church in the ſame kinde, called alſo the day of the Lord, of which 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.2. in which the man of ſin the ſon of perdition, that myſtery of iniquity ſhould be revealed, yea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the brightneſs of his coming, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his brings the Goſpel with it that was to be preached unto all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30. <hi>And then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man in Heaven, and then ſhall all the Tribes of the earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with power and great glory: and he ſhal ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> (the Goſpel aforeſaid) <hi>and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four winds,</hi> which time is by <hi>Zachariah</hi> deſcribed to be a gracious time, chap. 12.10, 11.12. and wiſhed and longed for by St <hi>John Revel.</hi> 1.7, 22. This ſeems to be that bleſſed time wherein Chriſt ſhall come in the ſpirit, but not in the body, as many Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts dream to errect a Kingdom throughout the earth in the hand of his Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14, 27, 28. which
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115397:186"/>kingdom ſhall continue a thouſand years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. yea, ſome are ſo bold as to ſay, that this comming of Chriſt, is the great day of judgment ſpoken of <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. and elſewhere; wherein Chriſt cometh ſpiritually with all his Saints, to give a true and upright ſentence concerning all ſpiritual things, good and evil; for which purpoſe they alledge that text, 1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 3.13. But St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes another judgement which ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after the thouſand years are ended <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.7, 8.15. which ſeem to be that very judgement which you aim at in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>And ſo ſixthly, and laſtly, There is Chriſts day, or time of his laſt coming to keep a great and general Aſſizes.</p>
                  <p>Thus much in reference to your firſt Section eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>In your ſecond Section we admit your reaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſhew why there ſhould be ſuch a judgement, with the proceedings then, and the ſeveral events by you ſet forth, and the rather becauſe you there in the manifeſtation of the glory of Gods juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt there probates ſeem to lay their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon their own diſobedience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, and no way aſcribe it to Gods abſolute pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition or ſoveraignty to the want of means, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace for their effectual calling, as you have done heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, For a peaceable and friendly concluſion, we grant you that which you aſſume in your third and laſt Section, namly, that Chriſt, would have us certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of a general judgement to deter all men from ſin, and for the greater conſolation of the godly, yet would he have us as well aſſured of our perſonal and particular going to judgement for the ſame ends; ſo, he would not have us ignorant of his ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but hope thereupon &amp; prepare our ſelvs thereunto, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. and though to take away ſecurity &amp; make us watchful, he would have the day and hour both of our
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115397:186"/>particular and his general judgment unknown unto us, yet by ſuch foregoing tokens and Characters as he hath ſet forth in his word, we ſhould learn to know his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, judgements and commings, and order our ſelves accordingly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.32, 33. <hi>Now learn a Parable of the Fig tree, when its branches are yet tender and pntteth forth leaves, you know that ſummer is nigh; ſo likewiſe you when ye ſhall ſee all theſe things, know that it is neer even at the door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt your 15. Article by you reviſed, and here publiſhed: we have not much to ſay, but what hath been ſpoken upon thoſe heads, and ſhould have had the leſs, if you had left them all ſtanding <hi>in ſtatu quo prius:</hi> And therefore we will here exhibite no articles againſt them, as being more Orthodox then your ſelves, though you hold them not for oracles.</p>
                  <p>We have here endeavoured to follow the Councel of St. <hi>Jude</hi> verſe 3. <hi>Earneſtly to contend for the faith, which was once given to the Saints: If any will be contentious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor: 11.16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But beloved building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith, praying in the holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, with exceeding joy: To the onely Wiſe God our Saviour, be Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Dominion and Power, Now and ever,</hi> Amen. <hi>Jude</hi> 20, 21, 24, 25.</p>
